# Chapter One Hundred and Seventy-Eight
# On the Knowledge of the Station of Love

Love is attributed to both human and God    by an attribution whose nature our knowledge cannot comprehend
Love¹ is taste, and its reality cannot be perceived    Is this not a lover! By God, by God
The necessities of love clothe me in its identity    A garment of the two certainties like one present yet absent
In us and in Him, yet we are not alike    Through love, the obligation of Truth is established wherever it is seen
I seek forgiveness from God for what I have said about Him    And I speak from the perspective of gratitude to God

Among what this chapter also contains is our saying:

I loved, for I am the beloved of the ecstatic one who is annihilated    And love from Him, my God, I praise with it
You have asked, though I know not your question    Words of light and guidance in the explicit text of the Furqan
About which love and about which measure    My knowledge is only of the love of the Lord who has no second
For every love that has a beginning proves it    An end, except the love of nature and the annihilated
And every love has a beginning but has no    Ends for it and deficiencies
They cannot be described, if you verify their status    As a pair with a pair, and a truth-bearer with a truth-bearer
The goal of love in the human is his connection    For His beneficence is the reward for my beneficence
And the goal of connection with the All-Merciful is heresy    If I do not envision Him, the accountable one will not know

Among what this chapter also contains is our saying:

I am the beloved of passion, if you but knew    And passion is our beloved, if you but understood
So if you comprehend my purpose    Then praise God the Exalted and proclaim
Why have my people turned away from my words?    Which of them is deaf to my expression?

What is wrong with my people who, from what has appeared,  
Have exaggerated about my Beloved in my existence?  
I do not love anyone from His creation,  
Nor anything other than my existence, so understand!  
Since I was composed and became a manifestation,  
And thus I was, so through me hold fast.  
I am the rope of Allah in your cosmos,  
So adhere to the door as servants and serve.  
And when I say I loved our Lord,  
Or an Imam, or the reins, then judge.  
It is an exquisite, beautiful allusion,  
Beneath it is an exalted, gracious light.  
And I am the garment upon its wearer,  
And the one who wears it does not know.  
There is nothing in the cloak except what  
Al-Hallāj said one day, so listen!  
By the life of Love, if I were to witness Him,  
I would be enthralled by my witnessing through you.  
The eye of the existence of Truth never sees  
From its origin, in any state, non-existence.

And among what this chapter contains is our saying:

Existence is for you to understand its meaning,  
And I have no hope in the cosmos except Him.  
The letter is meaning, and the meaning of the letter is its inhabitant,  
And the eye witnesses nothing but its meaning.  
And the heart, from where its nature enriches it,  
Transforms between its meaning and its meaning.  
Exalted is the Divine, none can contain Him,  
And after this, we said: We have encompassed Him.  
And I did not say this, rather the Hadith came with it  
From the Divine, and this is the substance of the expression.  
When the Divine Truth wanted us to inhabit Him,  
For that He created creation and fashioned it.  
So the essence of my existence became the essence of His form,  
A true revelation that none knows except Him.  
Allah is Greater, nothing resembles Him,  
And there is nothing besides Him, rather He is it.  
So the eye sees nothing possessing essence except non-existence,  
Thus it is certain that the perceived existence is Allah.  
So none sees Allah except Allah, so consider  
My words to know their meaning and their significance.

And among what this chapter also contains is our saying in a vision where I saw the Truth addressing me with the meaning in these

The verses, and He named me with a name I had never heard except from Him -Exalted is He- in that event, and it is "Bardanbāz." So I asked Him -Exalted is He- about the interpretation of this word, and He said: "One who traverses the abode." And these are the verses that have already appeared in this book at greater length than they are here, and I only wish to include here what occurred:

He settled you in my abode to manifest My form
So glory be to You, the Exalted, and glory be to Glory!
Your eyes have never seen one perfect like Me
Nor has any eye seen a human like you
Nothing in possibility is less than you
You established from the Law a proof for this
What wholeness could exist if not you
In every aspect, that is what was
You appeared to My creation in Adam's form
And made this permissible in the Laws as a matter of faith
If something less than you were possible
The existence of imperfection would be in Me, were it to exist
For you are distinguished by the form of My Presence
And what is less than Me cannot be, as has become clear

And among what this chapter also contains is our saying:

God is too great for anyone to attain Him
He is the Beloved, the High, the Master, the Eternal
The sun reaches us and we reach the sun
Yes, and from it comes to us kindness and support
Indeed we see it while it is manifest
Like the divine self-disclosure, yet no one has attained it
Light prevents us from qualifying it
So how about the One who cannot be qualified, yet is found?
Quality and quantity are attributes of bodies
And there is no body there, nor state, nor number

And among what this chapter also contains is our saying:

Hasten to repair what has passed of your life
And strive, and may the Merciful increase your provision on your journey
Say to Him with passion: "O ultimate goal of my hope
How the innermost secret and meaning long for your news!"
Indeed I knew that when I see the One
Through whom existence exists, I have never ceased to be in Your sight
Were it not for annihilation, and the negation of likeness to You, and what
Has come from You of the burning from Your sight
I would have no hope except in their witnessing
Nor would I read a book not about Your ways

I ask You, O One who has no likeness,    
For a matter by which I might reverse what is sealed from Your decree.

He said to me: From My grace is that you see My decree    
As My decree's coolness, and all of it is from your trace.

A prophet has come to you to remove    
What I have decreed, yet it does not increase your lifespan.

Yes, precious words, all of them pearls,    
And this is of pearls, so preserve it in your caskets.

And among what this chapter contains regarding the love of love is our saying:

When I saw love's greatness magnified    
And I had no power over it until death,

I fell in love with the love of love throughout my time, and did not say    
"Sufficient for me is what I have attained from it, sufficient."

Then the Beloved revealed to me the sun of His connection,    
By it my existence was illuminated, and the essence of my heart.

My heart melted in fear of His majesty,    
Then in that moment a line of security was granted to me.

I strolled¹ in the garden of intimacy with His beauty,    
So I became absent from the spirits and the two weighty ones.

He made me present while the secret from me was absent,    
And He made me absent while the matter from me was near.

If I say we are one, then it is His existence,    
And if they affirm my essence, then we are a pair.

But it is a mixture of subtle secret,    
He sees one who finds, while the world witnesses a second.

I said to Him, and He is the questioner, and indeed    
His most sublime expression flowed upon my tongue:

Is there not one who appeared in Himself to Himself    
With no number, so the essence from me is annihilated?

Your soul witnessed the precious one, blessed    
By your soul, and look in the mirror, you will see me.

O absent one whose station is this,    
He sees in the gardens of those standing with a gardener.

No, by the One to the beauty of whose Essence    
Hearts have flown, and He annihilated them from flying.

Know² - may God grant you success - that love is a divine station, for He described Himself with it, and named Himself al-Wadūd (the Loving). And in the report about it. And among what God revealed to Moses in the Torah: "O son of Adam; to Me you have a right of being loved, so by My right upon you, be loving toward Me." Love has been mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah regarding God and regarding created beings, and it is mentioned.

# Categories of the Beloved with Their Attributes, Mention of the Attributes that Allah Does Not Love, and Mention of the Types of People Whom Allah Does Not Love

He—the Exalted—said to His Prophet ﷺ commanding him to tell us: ﴾Say [O Muhammad], "If you love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you"﴿¹ And He—the Exalted—said: ﴾O you who have believed, whoever of you should renounce his religion - Allah will bring forth a people He loves and who love Him﴿²

And He said, mentioning the categories of those whom He loves: ﴾Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves﴿³ and ﴾He loves those who purify themselves﴿⁴ and ﴾He loves those who rely [upon Him]﴿⁵ and ﴾He loves the patient﴿⁶ and He loves the grateful, and He loves those who give charity, and ﴾He loves the doers of good﴿⁷ and ﴾Allah loves those who fight in His cause in a row as though they are a [single] structure joined firmly﴿⁸.

He also denied that He loves certain people due to attributes they possess which He does not love. The implication of this discourse is that He—Glory be to Him—loves the removal of these attributes, and they can only be removed by their opposites, necessarily. So He said: ﴾And Allah does not like corruption﴿⁹ and its opposite is righteousness; so whoever abandons corruption becomes righteous. And He said: ﴾Indeed, Allah does not love the corrupters﴿¹⁰ and ﴾He does not love the exultant﴿¹¹ and ﴾He does not love everyone self-deluded and boastful﴿¹² and ﴾He does not love the wrongdoers﴿¹³ and ﴾He does not love the transgressors﴿¹⁴ and ﴾He does not love the disbelievers﴿¹⁵ and ﴾He does not love... the public mention of evil in speech﴿¹⁶,¹⁷ and ﴾He does not love the transgressors﴿¹⁸.

Then He—Glory be to Him—endeared certain things to us: some through adornment, and others in an absolute sense. So He said, as a favor upon us: ﴾But Allah has endeared to you the faith﴿¹⁹ and He said: ﴾Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire﴿¹ the verse. And He said regarding spouses:

"And He placed between you affection and mercy."² And He forbade us from extending affection to the enemies of God, saying: "Do not take My enemy and your enemy as allies, extending to them affection."³

References to love in the Quran are numerous. As for the Traditions, there is his saying, peace be upon him, relating from God: "I was a hidden treasure and I loved to be known, so I created creation and made Myself known to them, and thus they knew Me." He created us only for Himself, not for us. Truly, You have linked reward with deeds: so our deeds are for us, not for Him. Yet our worship is for Him, not for us. And worship is not the same as deeds. The outward actions appearing in created beings are His creation, so He is the doer, and their goodness is attributed to Him out of proper etiquette with God, even though "All is from God"⁴ because He said: "By the soul and how He formed it, then inspired it with its wickedness and its righteousness"⁵ and "God created you and what you do"⁶ and He said: "God is the Creator of all things"⁷ so the deeds of servants are included in that.

And the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, said: "God says: My servants draw near to Me with nothing more beloved to Me than fulfilling what I have made obligatory upon them, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory acts until I love him. When I love him, I become his hearing with which he hears and his sight with which he sees..." and the rest of the hadith. From this divine manifestation, some have proclaimed unification (ittiḥād), based on His saying: "You did not throw when you threw, but God threw"⁸ and His saying: "and what you do." And in a Tradition: "God loves every tempted one who repents," and in another: "My love is established for those who love one another for My sake," and in another: "God is beautiful and loves beauty" and "God loves to be praised." And he, peace be upon him, said: "Three things of your world have been made beloved to me..." and the rest of the hadith. The Traditions in this chapter are very numerous. Know that love's station is noble, and it is the origin of existence.

From love we came forth
And upon love we were molded
When we turned aside from it, we were sought
And for this we were accepted¹⁰

===== page_7 =====

# This station has four titles, one of which is Love:

It is its purity reaching the heart, and its clarity from the turbidity of incidental matters, thus it has no purpose nor desire alongside its beloved.

## The second title: Affection (Wudd):

It has a divine name which is al-Wadūd (the Affectionate). Wudd comes from its firmness, which is steadfastness within it, and the watad (stake) is named watad due to its firmness in the earth.

## The third title: Passion ('Ishq):

It is excessive love. It is alluded to in the Qur'an as intense love in His saying: "And those who believe are more intense in love for Allah"¹ and it is [also] His saying: "He has impassioned her with love"² meaning that her love for Yusuf encompassed her heart like the shaghāf, which is the thin membrane that contains the heart, thus it is an extremity surrounding it. The Truth has described Himself in the tradition with intense love, although the names of 'ishq and 'āshiq (passionate lover) are not applied to the Truth. Passion is the envelopment of love around the lover, until it mingles with all his parts, and encompasses him³ with the encompassment of purity. (And it) is derived from the 'ashaqah (climbing vine).

## The fourth title: Ardent Desire (Hawā):

It is the exhaustion of will in the beloved, and attachment to it at the first moment it occurs in the heart. Allah does not have a name from it. Its occurrence has a cause: a glance, information, or beneficence. Its causes are many. Its meaning in the authentic divine tradition is: Allah's love for His servant when he performs abundant supererogatory good deeds. And likewise, following the Messenger in what he legislated. This is a station within us called hawā. One of them said regarding love generated by information⁴:

O people, my ear is in love with some of the tribe,
And the ear sometimes falls in love before the eye.

And we have, regarding love generated by sight and information, in our love poetry:

My love, by your life, depends upon sight,
Except for my passion for you, which is built upon information.
Allah knows that I have never known her,
Beyond what was said to me, to have anything more subtle than human form.

So it is possible for me, through my estrangement, to attain success with it
    And for it to be generous upon my eyes with the gaze

And also in this meaning we have:

My reality¹ I was in awe of it     And my sight did not increase it
If it had increased it     That eye's wick would not [have been lit]
When I beheld it     I came under the rule of the gaze
So I spent the night sharpened by it     Wandering until dawn
O my caution against my caution!     If only my caution would avail
By God, what concerned me     Was not the decree and destiny
Rather, what concerned me     Was the beauty of that poverty
How beautiful it is as something pleasant     Pastured in the place of dwelling²
When it is seen or thirsts     It captivates the minds of humans
It reveals a shade³ and     Love of a rain-giving cloud⁴
As if its portions     Are fragrances of perfumed musk
As if it is the morning sun     In light, or like the moon
If it unveils, it is revealed by     The light of a brightening dawn
Or if it lets down upon us     The darkness of that hair
O moon beneath the darkness     [Of] the garden of my heart, and leave⁵
My eye so that I may see you     If my fortune is my gaze
For the desire of my hand     Pours it from my knowledge

And also in this meaning we have:

² Al-Maqarr: everything named from trees or buildings
³ Al-Ẓill: the water of the human and his saliva
⁴ Ḥabb al-ghamām: hail

# The Poetic Verses:

The ear¹ is a lover and the eye is a lover        How different is the love of the eye from the report
For the ear loves what is revealed in form        And the eye loves what is sensible among forms
One day to see it delights in the gaze        In the form of sense that is never free from otherness
Except for the passion of Zaynab for it is a wonder        In it the fortune of hearing and sight are equal

And the most subtle aspect of love that I have found is when you experience excessive passion, intense desire, disturbing longing, ardent love, transformation, inability to sleep, and (inability to find) pleasure in food, yet you do not know² for whom, nor with whom, nor is your beloved identified to you.

This is the most subtle thing I have found in taste, then after that, by coincidence; a manifestation appears to you in unveiling, and that love becomes attached to it, or you see a person and that ecstasy which you find attaches to them when you see them; so you know that this was your beloved though you were unaware, or a person is mentioned and you find your inclination toward them with that passion which is within you, so you know that they are your companion.

And this³ is among the most hidden subtleties of the soul's foreknowledge of things, from behind the veil of the unseen, so it is ignorant of its state, and knows not with whom it is enamored, nor in whom it is enamored, nor what its concern is. People experience this in the contraction and expansion that has no known cause, and at that moment something comes that saddens them, so they know that contraction was for this matter. Or something comes that brings them joy, so they know that expansion was for this matter, and that is due to the soul's foreknowledge of matters before their formation in relation to the external senses, and these are the preliminaries of formation.

This resembles the taking of the covenant from the progeny that He is Lord, so no one could deny it afterward; thus we find in the innate nature of every human being a need for an existent being to rely upon, and that is God, though one is not aware of it. This is why He said: "O mankind, you are the ones in need of Allah"⁴ He is saying to them: that need which you find in yourselves is directed toward "Allah" and no other, but you do not recognize it. So through this, we came to know the Truth. And when we tasted this station, we said about it:

-------------------
¹ p. 123
² Perhaps closer to: know
³ p. 124
⁴ [Quran 35:15]

===== page_10 =====



I have been attached to whom I love for twenty years,
Yet I know not whom I love, nor do I recognize the harm.
My eye has not gazed upon the beauty of her face,
Nor have my ears ever heard mention of her.
Until lightning flashed from the side of the sanctuary,
Stirring me for a day and tormenting me for an age.

And we¹ also have in this meaning a taste, for we do not express except what we have tasted:

I have become attached to whom I love without knowing,
And I know not who this is that says "I know not."
I am bewildered in my state and my thoughts are bewildered,
And bewilderments themselves are bewildered in and in my affair.
While I, after twenty years,
Translate about love with the emotion of my secret,
I know not whom I love nor do I know their name,
Nor do I know who it is that fashioned my chest.
Until her face appeared to me from behind her veil,
Like the night clouds revealing a full moon.
I said to them: "Who is this?" It was said: "This is
The remnant of the eye of the heart, daughter of the brother of the chest."
So I proclaimed "Allahu Akbar" in reverence for her and her origin,
For my night with her surpasses the Night of Power.

And we have in this meaning a taste in my first entry to Damascus where I found² an unknown example for a long period, in a long divine story embodied in a bodily form. When it addressed us in that state and with its tongue:

I speak, and I have from your love what I have,
The speech of one to whom the Beloved said, "Tell me."
And when I entered Damascus, I was confounded in my mind,
For I had never seen before a lover like myself in passion.
I loved but knew not whom I had loved,
Is my Beloved my Creator or is he of my kind?
Has any lover other than us said this before me?
Perhaps I will see a person who agrees with me on this.
Following with hope, following like a shadow,
And I knew not, so look at my station and my abasement.
You have plunged, O poor one, into the sea of ignorance,
For I am from the people of learning and virtue.
Listen to my words and take the secret of my wisdom!
Then the caller of love called out from between my ribs.
I said: "My God, indeed my heart is enslaved,"
For I saw none but a specified beloved.

With seven and ten, and then fifty after them,    When you give preference to two over connection
There stands for you a wondrous square form    Complete in the connection that is in it and the separation
Like the name of Allah the Exalted, verified    It was a hidden name in the image of the origin
That is the name of whom you love, if you are knowing    And this is from knowledge that is annexed to transmission
If you possess understanding, seek nothing but    The triangulation of squareness, encompassing the form
You scatter it as a daughter and a daughter transformed    That with beautiful submission indicates coquetry
A daughter to an eye and a house for the glorious    They are the household of generosity and giving
And its beginning is a letter of ornament, saturated    From the six pens of the most noble virtue¹

This is the most subtle form of love. Below it is the love of love, which is being occupied with love rather than its object.

Layla came to Qays while he was crying out: "Layla, Layla," as he took ice and placed it upon his heart, which the heat of his heart would melt. She greeted him while he was in this state and said: "I am your sought one. I am right before your eyes. I am your beloved. I am the delight of your eye. I am Layla." He turned to her and said: "Away from me, for love of you has occupied me away from you." This is the most subtle aspect of love. Yet it is below what we mentioned in subtlety.

Our shaykh Abu al-Abbas al-Urayni—may Allah have mercy on him—used to ask Allah to grant him the desire for love, not love itself.

People have differed concerning its definition; and I have not seen anyone define it with an essential definition, indeed such is inconceivable. Those who have defined it have only defined it by its results, effects, and concomitants, especially since the Mighty Side has been described by it, and that is Allah. The best I have heard about it is what more than one person related to us from Abu al-Abbas ibn al-Arif al-Sanhaji. They said: We heard him say, when asked about love: "Jealousy is among the attributes of love, and jealousy refuses anything but concealment, so it cannot be defined."

Know that matters and objects of knowledge are of two types: those that can be defined and those that cannot be defined. And love, according to the scholars

¹ The second letter is represented by "n."
² There is an amendment in another handwriting that divides this verse into two verses (as in [manuscript] S) as follows:
"There stands for you a wondrous square form    Like the formation of the body from the image of the origin
There stands for you a wondrous square form    Complete in the connection that is in it and the separation"

³ Written above it in the original handwriting: "ṣ," and in the margin: "wondrous form" and above it "complete"

...among the speakers about it, among the matters that cannot be defined, so it is known by the one in whom it resides and whose attribute it is, yet one does not know what it is, nor deny its existence.

Know that any love that does not rule over its possessor to the extent that it makes him deaf to all sounds except what he hears from the speech of his beloved, blinds him to every sight except the face of his beloved, renders him mute to all speech except the mention of his beloved and those who love his beloved, and seals his heart so that nothing enters it except love for his beloved, and locks the storehouse of his imagination so that he imagines none but the image of his beloved—either from a vision he had previously or from a description from which the imagination creates an image—is as it has been said:

Your image is in my eye, your mention on my lips,
And your dwelling is in my heart—so where could you be absent?

Through it he hears yet does not hear, through it he sees yet does not see, through it he speaks yet does not speak. Indeed, the power of imagination reached such an extent with me that my beloved would become embodied externally to my eye, just as Gabriel would become embodied to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I could not help but look at him, and he would speak to me, and I would listen to him and understand from him. He left me for days unable to swallow food. Whenever the table was placed before me, he would stand at its edge, look at me, and say to me in a language I heard with my ear: "You eat while beholding me?" So I would abstain from food, yet find no hunger, and I would be filled by him until I grew fat and robust from gazing at him. Thus he took the place of nourishment for me. My companions and household members would marvel at my plumpness despite my lack of nourishment, for I would remain for many days not tasting anything, yet feeling neither hunger nor thirst. But he would never leave my sight: in my standing and sitting, my movement and stillness.

Know that love can only consume all of love when its beloved is the Truth—exalted is He—or someone of one's own kind: a female or male servant. As for anything else beneath these, love for it cannot completely consume one. We say this because a human can only face with his entire being someone who is in his image, when he loves him. For there is no part in him except that it has its counterpart in the other, so no excess remains through which he might become sober, not even a single element. His outer corresponds to the other's outer, and his inner to the other's inner. Do you not see that the Truth has named Himself the Outward and the Inward! Thus, love completely consumes the human being in relation to the Truth and to his own kind. This is not the case with other than one's own kind from the cosmos; for when one loves an image from the cosmos, one only faces it with the corresponding part, while the rest of one's being remains sober in its occupation.

The absorption in His love, when one loves God, is due to being created in His image as is reported in the tradition; thus one faces the Divine Presence with one's entire being. This is why all the Divine Names manifest in him. One who does not possess the attribute of love adopts them as character traits, while one who possesses the attribute of love becomes them. For this reason, love completely absorbs the human being, and when it attaches to God and God becomes his beloved¹, he remains in his love for the Real more intensely than his annihilation in the love of his similars. For in loving his similars, he loses, in his absence, the appearance of the beloved. But when the Real² is the beloved, he is in constant witnessing. And witnessing the beloved is like nourishment for the body; through it one grows and increases, so the more witnessing increases, the more love increases. This is why longing (shawq) is calmed by the encounter, while yearning (ishtiyāq) is stirred by the encounter, and this is what lovers experience when meeting the beloved: they are never satiated by witnessing the beloved, nor can they fulfill their desire for it. For the more they gaze upon the beloved, the more they experience passion and longing despite the beloved's presence with them. As it was said:

How strange that I yearn for them          And ask longingly about them while they are with me
My eyes weep for them while they are in my pupils          And my soul longs for them while they are between my ribs

Every love that leaves in the lover reason, by which he comprehends anything other than his beloved, or rationality, is not pure love, but merely self-talk. One of them said³:

There is no good in love managed by reason

The stories of lovers in this regard are too numerous to count. And regarding the increase of love with witnessing and longing:

I am absent and longing annihilates my soul, then I meet          Yet I am not annihilated, for longing is present and visible
An encounter occurs that I did not expect          And quenching becomes another ailment of passion
For I see a person whose beauty increases          When we meet, effacing and magnifying
There must be a passion that departs          From the increased beauty that appears purified

This refers to His manifestation—Glorified is He—in different forms in the Hereafter to His servants, and in this world to the hearts of His servants, as

It is reported in Sahih Muslim "About His transformation - glory be to Him - in forms as befits His essence without comparison or qualification."

By God, if not for the Shariah which came with divine information, no one would have known God, not even a thing despite the rational proofs which claim, according to the rational thinkers, to provide knowledge of His essence by stating what He is not and what He is not. No created being would have argued for Him. When divine information came through the tongues of revealed laws that He - glory be to Him - is such and such, matters whose apparent meanings contradict rational proofs, we loved Him for these affirmative attributes. Then, after creating doubt and establishing the cause and relationship necessitating love, He said: "There is nothing like unto Him"¹, thus negating the causes necessitating love which reason had negated through its proofs. This is the meaning of His saying: "I created creation so that I might be known to them, and thus they knew Me." God is only known through what He has informed about Himself: His love for us, His mercy toward us, His compassion, His solicitude, His love, and His descent in renewal. For His likeness - exalted is He - and placing Him before our eyes: in our hearts, in our direction of prayer, and in our imagination, until it is as if we see Him, no, rather we see Him within us; because we have known Him through His self-disclosure, not through our speculation.

Among us are those who see Him yet are ignorant of Him. Just as He needs no other, likewise, by God, He loves nothing in existence other than Himself; He is the manifest in every beloved, to the eye of every lover, and there exists nothing but lovers. Thus the entire cosmos is lover and beloved, and all of this returns to Him. Just as none but He is worshipped, for the worshipper worships only through imagining divinity in the object of worship, and without this imagination there would be no worship. The Exalted says: "Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him"². And likewise with love: no one has loved anything but their Creator, but they are veiled from Him - exalted is He - by the love of Zaynab, Su'ad, Hind, Layla, the dinar, the dirham, status, and everything beloved in the world. Thus poets establish their words about existents while they do not know.

The knowers hear no poetry, nor riddle, nor praise, nor love lyric except about Him, from behind the veil of forms. The cause of this is divine jealousy that any other than He should be loved. For love is caused by beauty, and beauty belongs to Him. Since beauty is loved for itself, and "God is beautiful and loves beauty," He loves Himself. Its other cause is beneficence, and there is no beneficence except from God, and no benefactor except God. So if you are loved for beneficence, none is loved but God, for He is the Benefactor. And if you are loved for beauty, none is loved but God - exalted is He - for He is the Beautiful. Thus in every aspect what is attached

# Love is None but God

When the Real knew Himself, He knew the cosmos from Himself, and He brought it forth upon His image; so it became for Him a mirror in which He sees His form, and He loved none but Himself. Thus His saying: "God will love you"¹ is in reality: He loved Himself. Since following is the cause of love, and His following His image in the mirror of the cosmos is the cause of love, because He sees none but Himself. And the cause of love is the supererogatory acts (nawāfil), which are the additions. And the form of the cosmos is an addition in existence. So He loved the cosmos as a supererogatory act; thus He became its hearing and its sight so that He loves none but Himself.

How obscure is this question, and how quickly the imagination overturns it! For a strange matter has occurred in existence. That is, there are matters which the intellect verifies and upon which it remains firm without wavering, yet they escape from the imagination, which is unable to grasp them—like this question: the intellect affirms it and cannot depart from it, yet it escapes from the imagination, which cannot grasp it. And there are other matters that are the opposite: they escape from the intellect, but are firmly established in the imagination, which rules over them and affects them.

Like one whose intellect tells him, through its demonstration, that his provision will inevitably come to him, whether he strives for it or not. This knowledge slips away from² the intellect, and the imagination rules over it with its authority: that if you do not strive to seek it, you will die. So he rises to work to attain it. His right from the perspective of his intellect vanishes, while his falsehood from the perspective of his imagination remains established without wavering. Or like one who sees a snake or a lion in a form that, according to what the intellect indicates, cannot possibly harm him. Yet he becomes absent from that proof and imagines its harm: so he flees from it, and his countenance and inner state change due to the rule and authority of the imagination. And this is observable.

So the imagination has authority in certain domains, and the intellect has authority in other domains. Let us mention in this chapter—God willing—what is possible of the necessities of love and its stations, and so we say:

Love is a specific attachment among the attachments of the will; love only attaches to what is non-existent, not present at the time of attachment, desiring the existence of that beloved or its occurrence. I say "or its occurrence" because it may attach to the non-existence of existence, and the non-existence of the existent while the existent is existing is not occurring. When the existent to which love is attached becomes non-existent, then it has occurred. It is not said: "the non-existence has come into existence," for that is impossible from the one who says it. Our saying "desiring the existence of that beloved," when the beloved in reality is only non-existent. That is because the beloved that is admired is the desire for the love of connection with this specific person, whoever it may be: if it is among those whose nature is to be embraced, then it is necessary

---

¹ [Quran 3:31]
² p. 129 b

===== page_16 =====

His embracing, or to marry him: then his marriage is valid, or to sit with him: then his sitting is valid. His love is attached only to what is non-existent, at that moment, from this person. He imagines that his love is attached to the person, but it is not so. This is what blinds him to meeting and seeing him. If he loved his person, or his existence in his essence, he is in his personhood or in his existence, then there is no benefit in attaching love to him.

If you say: We concede; that just as we love sitting with a person, or kissing him, or embracing him, or being intimate with him, or his conversation; then you see that happens, yet love does not disappear with the presence of embrace and union. Therefore, the object of love may not be non-existent. We say: You are mistaken; when you embrace the person to whom love is attached through his embrace, or sitting with him, or intimacy with him; the object of your love in that state is not what is present, but rather the continuance and persistence of what is present, and continuance and persistence are non-existent: they have not entered into existence, nor do they have a finite duration. Therefore, love in the state of union is only attached to what is non-existent, which is its continuance.

How excellent is what appears in the Quran in His saying: "He loves them and they love Him"³ with the pronoun of the absent and the future tense verb. He only attributed the object of love to the absent and non-existent, and everything absent is relatively non-existent. Among the qualities of love is that the lover combines opposites in his love, to validate being upon the [divine] image, due to what it contains of choice. This is the difference between natural love and spiritual love, and only the human combines them both. Animals love but do not combine opposites, unlike humans. The human combines⁴ opposites in his love because he is upon His image, and He has described Himself with opposites, in His saying: "He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden"⁵.

The form of love's combination of opposites is that among its inherent qualities is: love of connection with the beloved, and among its inherent qualities is: love of what the beloved loves. If the beloved loves separation, and the lover loves separation, then he has done what love does not require; for love demands connection. And if he loves connection, he has done what love does not require; for the lover loves what his beloved loves, and he has not done so. Thus the lover is confounded in every case, and the ultimate combination between them is that he loves the beloved's love for separation, not separation itself, while he loves connection. This issue does not extend beyond most

From this: Such as being content with divine decree, so the name 'contentment with divine decree' is valid for him even while he is not content with what is decreed, when what is decreed is disbelief. And thus the Law has come. And likewise in the matter of love: love necessitates connection with the beloved, and the beloved's love may desire separation, but [the lover] does not love separation; because separation is not from the beloved's love of separation, just as divine decree is not identical to what is decreed; for divine decree is God's judgment regarding what is decreed, not the very thing decreed. So one is content with God's judgment.

The love of animals is not like this; because it is natural love, not spiritual. It seeks connection with the one it loves specifically, and does not know that its beloved desires such and such, it has no knowledge of that. For this reason, we have divided love, which is a quality of the human being, into two types: there is natural love, by which¹ he shares with beasts and animals, and spiritual love, by which he is distinguished from the love of animals. And when this is established:

* * *

Connection

Know that love is of three types: divine, spiritual, and natural. There is no love other than these. Divine love is God's love for us. Our love for God may also be called divine. Spiritual love is that by which one strives to please the beloved, having no purpose or will of one's own with the beloved; rather, one is exclusively subject to what is desired of him. Natural love is that by which one seeks to attain all² his purposes, whether that pleases the beloved or not. And this characterizes most people's love today. Let us first address divine love in a connection, then follow it with a connection on spiritual love, then follow it with a third connection on natural love. ﴾And Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the way.﴾³

* * *

The First Connection: On Divine Love

This is that He loves us for ourselves and for Himself. As for His love for us for Himself, it is His saying: "I loved to be known, so I created creation, and made Myself known to them, and they knew Me." He created us only for Himself so that we might know Him, and His saying: ﴾And I created not the jinn

"And [I have not created] mankind except to worship Me."¹ So He created us only for Himself.

As for His love for us; when He made known to us the works² that lead us to our happiness, and protect us from matters that do not suit our purposes, nor harmonize with our natures, He—glory be to Him—created creation to glorify Him. Thus He made them articulate His glorification, praise, and prostration to Him. Then He informed us of this, saying: "And there is not a thing except that it glorifies Him with praise."³ That is, by praising Him for what He is and what comes from Him. And He also informed us, saying: "Do you not see that Allah is glorified by whoever is in the heavens and the earth and the birds with wings spread? Each has known its prayer and glorification."⁴ So it adhered to that and persisted in it. And He addressed with this verse His Prophet ﷺ who witnessed it and saw it, so He said to him: "Do you not see?" and did not say: "Do you (plural) not see?" For we have not seen it; it is faith for us, but for Muhammad ﷺ it is direct vision⁵. Likewise, He also said to him when He showed him the prostration of everything: "Do you not see that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures, and many of the people?"⁶ For He mentioned: "whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth," thus mentioning the upper and lower worlds, and showed him the prostration of everything.

So everyone whom Allah has shown this and who has seen it falls under this address. And this is a natural, inherent glorification resulting from a manifestation that was manifested to them, so they loved Him; thus they were impelled to praise Him without imposition, but rather by inherent requirement. And this is the intrinsic worship in which Allah established them by virtue of the deservingness that He deserves.

Likewise, He said regarding the people of unveiling, who are the common people and every rational being: "Have they not seen what Allah has created of things, how their shadows incline⁷ to the right and to the left, prostrating to Allah while they are humble?"⁸ This is the share of visual bliss. Then He informed that this inclination to right and left is a prostration to Allah, and humility and lowliness before His majesty, saying: "prostrating to Allah while they are humble." So He described them as rational beings themselves, such that they prostrate to Allah in humility. Then He informed, saying by way of reminder: "And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens"—meaning the inhabitants of the heavens—"and whatever is on the earth of creatures"—meaning whatever moves.

upon them. He says: they walk¹, ﴿and the angels﴾ meaning those who are neither in heaven nor earth. Then He said: ﴿and they do not disdain²﴾ meaning from the worship of their Lord. Then He described them as fearful to let us know that they have knowledge of whom they prostrate to. Then He described those among them who are commanded that they do what they are ordered to do, and they are those about whom He said: ﴿They disobey not Allah in what He commands them and do what they are commanded³﴾. Then He said concerning those who are with their Lord: ﴿They glorify Him by night and day, and they never flag⁴﴾ meaning they do not grow weary.

All of this indicates that the entire cosmos is in the station of witnessing and worship, except for every created being that possesses the faculty of thought, which is exclusively the rational souls of humans and jinn, in terms of the essences of their souls, not in terms of their forms. For their forms, like the rest of the cosmos, glorify and prostrate to Him.

All the limbs of the body articulate His glorification. Do you not see how they testify against the souls that command them on the Day of Resurrection - the skins, hands, feet⁵, tongues, hearing, sight, and all faculties? ﴿So the judgment belongs to Allah, the Most High, the Great⁶﴾.

All this stems from the rule of His love for them for His sake. Whoever fulfills his gratitude [is rewarded], and whoever does not fulfill it, He punishes. He loves Himself, and He loves His glorification and praise.

As for His love for us for our sake: He has made known to us the beneficial affairs of this world and the next, and He has established for us the proofs of knowing Him so that we may know Him and not remain ignorant of Him. Then He has provided for us and bestowed favors upon us despite our negligence after our knowledge of Him, and despite the establishment of proof for us that every blessing we enjoy comes only from His creation and returns to Him, and that He only brought it into existence for our sake so that we may enjoy it and subsist thereby, and He has left us to eat and enjoy ourselves. Then, after this complete beneficence, we have not thanked Him, though reason dictates gratitude to the benefactor, and we know that there is no benefactor except Allah.

Among His beneficence is that He sent us a messenger from Himself as a teacher and mentor. He informed us of what we have in His mind. He prescribed for us the path leading to our happiness and made it clear, and He warned us against destructive matters and avoiding base and blameworthy character traits. Then He established the proof of his [the messenger's] truthfulness for us; he came with clear evidences, and cast into our hearts the light of faith and His proof.

To us, and He adorned it in our hearts, and made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to us; so we believed and affirmed. Then He bestowed upon us success; and employed us in what He loves and what pleases Him. Thus we knew that had He not chosen us, none of this would have occurred, then indeed His mercy preceded His wrath. And though the wretched become wretched, the encompassing of mercy, providence, and the primordial love which influences the outcomes is inevitable.

And when love preceded and the word was established and mercy encompassed, and the worldly abode was a place of mixture and veiling according to what the Mighty, the Knowing decreed; He created the Hereafter, and transferred us to it, which is an abode that does not accept false claims. There, all acknowledge His Lordship, just as they acknowledged His Lordship in the grasp of particles from Adam's back.

So we were, in the worldly abode, in the middle between two extremes: the extremes of oneness and acknowledgment. And in the middle, polytheism occurred alongside the affirmation of existence, so the middle was weakened. That is why they said: "We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah in proximity," thus attributing greatness and majesty to Allah—Exalted is He—even in their polytheism. Then the Exalted informed that He sealed the heart of everyone who outwardly appeared with the attributes of pride and power, and He did not place these in their hearts because of the seal of providence; thus they find themselves, through necessary knowledge, abased and humbled by that seal; so pride against Allah never entered any created heart whatsoever. And if attributes of pride appear from someone, they are but an outer appearance with no inner reality. All of this stems from His mercy and love for His creation so that the final outcome may be happiness.

When the middle weakened and the two extremes strengthened, the matter was settled in the end and the two abodes were filled, and He placed in each of them blessings for their inhabitants to enjoy, after Allah purified them through the suffering they endured, so they might receive bliss in a state of purity. Do you not see how the slain says: How does that killing purify him from the injustice of the killing by which the one who was killed was killed, for the sword erases. Likewise, the implementation of legal punishments in this world is all purification for the believers, even the bite of a flea and the prick of a thorn. And there is another group upon whom the punishments of the Hereafter are implemented in the Fire so they may be purified, then they receive mercy in the Fire through the precedence of loving providence, even if they do not exit the Fire.

Allah's love for His servants is not characterized by beginning or end; for it does not accept temporal events or accidents. Rather, the essence of His love for His servants is the very essence of the beginning of their existence, those who came before and those who will come after, unto that which has no end. So the relation of Allah's love for them,

---------------------

[Az-Zumar: 3]

===== page_21 =====

The relation of His Being with them wherever they are, in the state of their non-existence and in the state of their existence; for just as He is with them in the state of their existence, He is with them in the state of their non-existence; because they are known to Him, witnessed by Him, loved by Him eternally, and will continue to be so.

No judgment has newly come upon Him that was not already upon Him; rather, He has always encompassed His creation, just as He has always known them.

His saying: "So I loved to be known" is an instruction for us about what the matter was in itself, all of this as befits His majesty. He - the Exalted - can only be conceived as an active creator. And every entity that was non-existent in itself was known to Him, and its bringing into existence was beloved to Him. Then He brought existence to it, rather He brought existence into it, rather He clothed it with the garment of existence, so it became itself, then another, then another in succession and sequence from the first existent that is attributed to the firstness of the Truth. And there is no other existent, but rather existence established in individuals, so the "other" is in genera and species. And individuals in created things are only in a special species, finite in the Hereafter, even if the world is finite. So the existents are new with no end to their coming into being, because the possibles have no end: their continuance is perpetual just as eternity is established and necessary in the right of the Truth. There is no beginning to His existence, so there is no beginning to His love for His servants - glory be to Him.

The mention of love occurs with the beloved at the time of divine instruction, not love itself. The Quran is the speech of God; He has always been speaking, and yet He said in meaning: "No reminder comes to them from their Lord that is new"³ because the reminder is new to us, not in itself, from our master and owner and reformer and restorer, and "No reminder comes to us from the Most Merciful that is new"⁴. The reminder from the Most Merciful occurs as new to us, not in itself. So mercy and blessing and beneficence are in the beginning and the end and the return, and no name of wretchedness has been mentioned in what comes, rather it is "Lord" or "Most Merciful" to let you know what is in His self for you.

Supplement on Divine Love:

It is our loving God, for God says: "He loves them and they love Him"⁵. And the attribution of love to us⁶ is not the attribution of love to Him. The love attributed to us from the perspective of what our reality entails is divided into two types: one is called spiritual love, and the other natural love. And our love for God - the Exalted - is with both loves together, and this is a difficult matter.

Conceptualization: As not every soul is granted knowledge of matters as they truly are, nor is granted faith in them according to what has come from God in His news about Himself. For this reason, God bestowed such a favor upon His Prophet ﷺ, saying: "And thus We have revealed to you a spirit of Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what faith was, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants." Thus, by God's praise, we are among those of His servants whom He willed.

After this division, there remain only four categories in our love for Him, which are: either we love Him for His sake; or we love Him for our own sake; or we love Him for both combined; or we love Him for none of what we have mentioned. Here arises another consideration: why do we love Him? Since it is established that we love Him, but not for His sake, nor for our sake, nor for both combined, what then is this fourth matter? This is a chapter.

Then another division: if we love Him, do we love Him through ourselves? Or love Him through Him? Or love Him through both combined? Or love Him through none of what we mentioned? All of this will be explained and discussed, God willing. Likewise, in this completion, we shall mention what we were summoned to in our love for Him. Does this love have an end-point to which it leads, or not? If it has an end, what is that end? This question was asked of me by none except a subtle woman among the people of this matter.

Then we shall also mention—God willing—is love a psychological quality in the lover? Or a meaning additional to his essence, existential? Or is it merely a relation between the lover and the beloved with no real existence? All of this is necessary for this completion.

Know that love does not accept partnership, but if the essence of love is one and indivisible; if it is composite, it is possible for its love to attach to different aspects, but for different matters. Even if the entity to which these different matters are attributed is one, or if those matters exist in many within it; then love can attach to many, so a person may love many beloveds. If it is valid that love can love more than one, it may love many, as the Commander of the Faithful said:

The three harmonious ones possessed my rein    And settled in my heart in every place

Here is a hidden secret in his saying "my rein" in the singular, not giving these beloveds different reins from himself. This indicates that this love, though composite, loved only one meaning that existed for him in these three; that is

[Al-Shura: 52]
p. 135
615

===== page_23 =====

The meaning exists in the essence of each one of them. The proof of this is his statement at the completion of the verse: "And she settled in my heart in every place."

If he loved a meaning from each one that did not exist in the other, then the rein he gives to one would be different from the rein he gives to the other, and the place that one occupies would be different from the place that the other occupies.
Thus this is one who loved one; and that beloved one exists in many, so he loved the many for that reason.
God—exalted is He—loves both for him.

Among us are those who love Him for themselves. And among us are those who love Him for the whole, and this is more complete in love, because it is more complete in knowledge of God and witnessing; for among us are those who know Him in witnessing, so they love Him for the whole. And among us are those who know Him not in witnessing, but in report: so they love Him for Him. And among us are those who know Him in blessings so they love Him for themselves. And among us are those who love Him for the whole. This is because witnessing can only occur in a form, and form is composite, and love has a composite form: so one hears from one aspect and loves Him for the report, like His saying through the tongue of His Prophet: "Have you visited Me in a friend or opposed Me in an enemy?"

When you love things for His sake, and oppose things for His sake, this is the meaning of our love for Him and nothing else. From us, with all that He loves from us, is that we stand by it willingly, and whoever does not witness Him from our form is in the status of blessings just as our limbs are to us, and our animality is under the rule of the rational soul: it cannot disobey it; because they are like instruments for it, which it directs as it wishes in God's pleasure, and in what is not His pleasure. Every part of human limbs, if left to itself, can only act in what pleases God, for it belongs to Him. And everything in existence is of this status except for the two weighty ones [humans and jinn], as He says: "There is nothing that does not glorify Him with praise." He means by this glorification praise of God, not for reward, because it is in intrinsic worship with which the seeking of recompense is inconceivable. This is from its love for Him—glorified is He.

Except for some rational souls, when the faculty of thought was given to them in the knowledge of God, they could not endure the knowledge of God, and for this He seized them in the outpouring of progeny from their loins, and made them bear witness against themselves a testimony of compulsion, so they prostrated to God unwillingly not willingly, because of being seized, then He released them freed from that special seizing, and it is

Imposed upon her without her awareness, so she imagines that she is at liberty? When she found distinction for this dark temple, she proceeded in matters according to what served her purpose, loving nothing except what suits her nature, and became heedless of the witnessing of her acknowledgment of the Lordship of her Creator over her.

While she was in this state, the faculty of thought said to her: "You have employed all faculties, yet you have neglected me though I am installed within you. I am one of your instruments, yet you pay me no attention, so employ me."¹ She replied to it:² "Yes, do not reproach me³ for I was ignorant of your rank. I now grant you permission to act according to what your reality dictates, until I verify what you truly are, so that I may direct you properly and employ you." It said: "I hear and obey." Then the faculty of thought turned its face toward her as a teacher and said: "You have been heedless of your essence and your existence. Have you always⁴ existed thus for yourself? Or were you non-existent⁵ and then came to be?" The soul said: "I was not, then I was." Thought said: "So this One who brought you into being, is it your very self, or other than you? Think⁶ and verify and employ me; for this work is what I am for."

So the soul thought, and came to know through what the evidence showed her that she did not bring herself into existence, and that she exists through another. Hence, the poverty inherent in her existence is essential, as evidenced by what she finds within herself of natural pains, making her dependent on customary means to remove those⁷ pains. Through this need, she knew that she is poor, in the existence of her essence, to the Cause that brought her into being.

When her temporal origination was established for her, and it was confirmed that she has a cause that brought her into existence, she then reflected: and she knew that this Cause could not resemble her, for then it would be poor like her, and that it could not correspond to these causes that remove her pains, as she witnesses the temporal origination of these⁸ causes after they were not, and their susceptibility to transformation and corruption. Thus it was established within her that she has a Creator who brought her into being, and who brought into being everything that resembles her among temporal things, and the causes that remove her pains. She became aware that there is something, without which she would have remained afflicted⁹ with disease and ailment. So out of mercy toward her, He created for her these causes that remove her pains, and she had always loved these causes and rushed toward them by nature.

The translation of this Ibn Arabi text from the Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya follows:

Thus the attachment of that love transferred from the cause to the Originator of those causes, and it said: "He is more deserving of my love, but I do not know what pleases Him so that I may deal with Him accordingly." So it acquired a proof and loved Him for what He had bestowed upon it of its existence, and the existence of what is suitable for it. And here it stopped. And in all of this it was heedless and forgetful of its acknowledgment of the lordship of its Originator in the grasp of the Manifest One.

While it was in this state, a caller came to it from outside, from its own kind, claiming to be a messenger from the One who brought it into existence. It said to him: "You are like me, and I fear you may not be truthful; do you have anyone who can verify you? For I have a faculty of thought by which I have arrived at the knowledge of my Originator." So he presented evidence to verify his claim. It contemplated this until his truthfulness was established, and it believed in him. He then informed it that the Originator who had brought it into existence had previously taken hold of it and made it bear witness to His lordship, and that it had indeed testified to this. It said: "I have no recollection of this, but from now on I will fulfill the obligation of that acknowledgment, for you are truthful in your report. But I do not know what actions of mine would please Him. If you would set limits and prescribe practices for me to observe, so that He may know I am among those who fulfill their gratitude for what He has bestowed upon me." So he prescribed what was ordained.

It fulfilled this out of gratitude, even if it contradicted its inclination, and it did not do this out of fear or desire, because when he initially prescribed what he prescribed and informed it that its observance of these practices would please Him, he did not mention what reward it would receive for this, nor what punishment it would incur if it disobeyed. So this pure soul hastened to please Him in this and said: "There is no god but God," as it was told to say.

Then afterward, he informed it of the abundant reward and complete blessing it would receive for this, and the punishment for whoever opposes His law. Thus, another form of worship was added to its worship of Him out of love and contentment—specifically—worship motivated by desire for reward and fear of punishment. So it combined two aspects in its worship: worship for His sake, and worship out of desire and fear. It loved Him for His sake and for its own sake, due to its multiplicity in its nature and spirituality. Desire and fear were represented through its nature, while its worship of Him out of love for Him was connected to its spirituality. For if it loves anything among existents besides Him, it loves it from its spirituality for His sake, and from its nature for the attainment of its purpose.

When the Real saw it in this state—knowing that divisibility is part of its reality—and that it had combined the two loves; and He

He has described Himself as jealous: He does not want partnership, and He wanted to claim it [the soul] exclusively for Himself so that it would love none but Him. So He manifested to it in a natural form, and gave it a sign that it cannot deny within itself, which is expressed as necessary knowledge. Thus it knew that He is this form, and inclined toward Him both spiritually and naturally.

When He possessed it, and knew that causes must affect it by virtue of its nature, He gave it a sign by which to recognize Him, then revealed Himself to it through that sign in all causes whatsoever. It recognized Him, and loved the causes for His sake, not for their own. Thus it became entirely His, not belonging to its nature, nor to any cause other than Him. It saw Him in everything. So it departed and was delighted, and saw that it had been distinguished from other souls by this reality.

Then He revealed Himself to it in the very essence of its natural and spiritual self through that sign, and it saw that it had only seen Him through Him, not through itself, and that it had only loved Him through Him, not through itself: it was He who loved Himself, not it that loved Him. And it looked at Him in every existent thing with that very same eye, and knew that none but He had loved Him: for He is the lover and the beloved, the seeker and the sought.

And through all this, it became clear to it that its love for Him is for His sake and for its own sake. When it witnessed in this other level that its love for Him was only through Him, not through itself, nor through the combination, and there is nothing additional except non-existence. So it wanted to know the measure of that love, and what its ultimate purpose is. Thus it paused at His saying: "I was a hidden treasure and I loved to be known," and it had known Him when He revealed Himself to it in a natural form. So it knew that He deserves, from that form in which He appeared to it, the name of the Manifest and the Hidden. Thus it knew that the love with which He loved to be known is only in the Hidden attributed to Him, and it knew that it is the nature of love, when it exists in form, to breathe, because of the pleasure of what is sought in that breath. That breath emerged from the origin of love in creation, which desires to make Himself known to them so they may know Him. So there was the Cloud (al-ʿamāʾ) called the created Truth, and that Cloud became the substance of the world, receiving the forms of the world and its spirits² and all its natures, and it is receptive unto infinity. This is the beginning of His love for us.

As for our love for Him, its beginning is hearing, not seeing, and it is His saying to us, while we are in the substance of the Cloud: "Be!"¹ So the Cloud is from His Breath, and the forms expressed as the world are from the word: "Be!"¹ Thus we are His words which are inexhaustible. The Exalted said:

# "His Word which He conveyed to Mary,"¹ which is Jesus, "and a Spirit from Him," which is the breath. And that reality flows in all living beings. When God wishes to cause its death, He removes from it the breath; for the breath was its life—and in the chapter on the breath, the forms of its creations in the world will be explained. When we heard His speech, while we were established in the substance of the cloud (ʿamāʾ), we could not refrain from coming into existence: so we became forms in the substance of the cloud. By our manifestation in the cloud, we gave existence to the cloud, after it was a conceptual existence, it attained actual existence. This was² the cause of the beginning of our love for Him. For this reason we move and are delighted upon hearing melodies, because of the word "Be!" (kun) which issues from the Divine form; in the unseen and the witnessed.

The witnessed form of the word "Be" is twofold: a kāf and a nūn. Similarly, the world of witnessing has two aspects: outer and inner. Its outer aspect is the nūn, and its inner aspect is the kāf. This is why the kāf in the human being emerges deeper in the world of the unseen, for it is from the furthest letters of the throat, between the throat and the tongue. And the nūn is from the letters of the tongue. The unseen of this word is the "wāw" between the kāf and the nūn. It is from the letters of the lips. Thus it has manifestation. It is a letter of infirmity (ʿilla), not a sound letter. This is why creation (takwīn) came from it, because it is a letter of infirmity. And since it is from the letters of the lips through the extension of breath from outside the lips to the outer existence, this is why the spirit has governance in the body. Actions and movements appear from it because of its spirit, while its spirit remains unseen, because the wāw has no existence in the witnessed realm, as it is elided due to its stillness and the stillness of the nūn. It works from behind a veil, thus it is invisible in essence yet manifest in governance.

The ultimate goal of our love for Him is to know the reality of what love is: Is it a quality essential to the lover? Or a meaning within him? Or a relation between the lover and the beloved? It is the connection that draws the lover to seek union with the beloved. We say: It is a quality essential to the lover. If it is said: We see it ceasing? We say: It is impossible for it to cease except with the cessation of the lover from existence, and the lover does not cease from existence. So love does not cease, but what can conceivably cease is its attachment to a specific³ beloved. That specific attachment can cease, and that connection with that particular beloved can cease, and it can become attached to another beloved, or it may be attached to many beloveds, so the connection between the lover and a specific beloved is severed. Yet it [love] exists in itself, for it is the essence of love, so its cessation is impossible.

Love is the very essence of love itself, not an attribute or quality within it that could be removed, thus removing its effects. The connection is the relation between the lover and the beloved, and love is the very essence of love, nothing else. So attribute love to whomever you wish, whether temporal or otherwise, for love is nothing but the essence of love itself. There exists in existence only a lover and a beloved. But it is in the nature of the beloved to be necessarily non-existent, so one loves either the bringing into existence of that non-existent thing, or its occurrence in something existent, necessarily, not in something non-existent. This is a verified matter, inescapable.

The connection that exists in love is only in that existent thing, which accepts either the existence of that beloved, or its occurrence, not its existence, if the beloved cannot¹ be characterized by existence but can be characterized by occurrence. An example of this: when a person loves the annihilation of an existing matter, due to the harm its existence causes him—like pain, which is an existential matter in the one experiencing it—so he loves its annihilation. His beloved is annihilation, which is not yet occurring. When the pain is removed, its removal is its non-existence after its existence, by its transition to non-existence. So in such cases we speak of occurrence, not existence. The beloved is always non-existent. The love of the existent, as a whole, is not valid, except in terms of connection, as it only relates to an existent in which the existence of that non-existent beloved appears, as we have explained earlier in this chapter.

It has thus become clear to you in this complement: the nature of love, its generator, its purpose, why the lover loves, and his love for his beloved or for himself. All this has been clarified, so let us now turn to discussing the second connection—if God Most High wills. We have obtained in divine love what is sufficient according to the measure of time.

### The Second Connection: On Spiritual Love

It is the comprehensive love in love that one loves the beloved for the beloved's sake and for one's own sake; since natural love only loves the beloved for one's own sake. Know that spiritual love, when love is characterized by intellect and knowledge, is wise through its intellect and is empowered through knowledge; thus it arranges matters in the arrangement of wisdom, and does not exceed their proper stations: so it knows what love is, what the meaning of lover is, what the reality of the beloved is, and what it wants from the beloved. And does the beloved have will and choice, so that one loves what the beloved loves? Or does it have no will, so one loves only for oneself? Or is it the existent that does not want the existence of its beloved except in the essence of that existent? So to this extent we say about the existent: it is beloved, even if it exists only in it, not its essence.

That existent, if it is among those characterized by will, it is possible to love it for its own sake, not for oneself. And if it is not characterized by will, then the lover loves the beloved only for oneself, I mean for the sake of love itself, not for the beloved; for the beloved is not characterized as having love for anything, or having any purpose. But that in which this beloved exists may possess will, so it becomes incumbent upon love to love what that existent loves: thus loving it for its sake, but by way of following. This is what love gives. For love by its essence seeks connection, after seeking the existence of its beloved; for the very essence of the beloved's existence (is) the essence of its connection, necessarily. And this is our saying:

The time of existence is the time of connection       The time of affection is "eat and drink"³

This verse is from one of our poems about the manifestation of a reality that was revealed to us in a witnessed presence, which is:

I wondered at a sin in passion       While we have no path but it

When the light of the one who       Stirred the innermost being was manifested to us, the flame was revealed

Its soul was humbled in lowliness       Before it, while passion is ever wondrous

There was not between the occurrence of passion    And the attainment of desire a span to be traversed

For when passion occurs, the breath and cooling happens, so the breath emerges in such a way that it forms in the soul of love an image of the beloved, thus manifesting it as a form externally which one witnesses. Thus one attains one's goal and delight in it without time, as previously mentioned in the discussion of the existence of the cloud (ʿamāʾ). So we said, and we said after this in the same poem:

I marveled at God's mercy upon me    And about one like me, is it fitting to marvel?¹
The time of affection is the time of existence    The time of union – eat and drink
So where is the ardent love and where is the sickness    And where is the intense love – indeed, marvel!
Pure of garment, veiled    She is not attributed to anyone

For the beloved, as we said, must necessarily be non-existent. And in the state of its non-existence, it is pure of garment² when it first comes into existence, because it has not acquired anything that would blemish or soil it at its first appearance and existence. The original state is purity, which is indicated in his saying: "Every child is born upon the natural disposition (fiṭra)," which is purity.

And our saying "veiled" refers to its non-existence, which we mentioned, from witnessing existence. And our saying "She is not attributed to anyone" is because the non-existent cannot be attributed, but love seeks it for itself. Then we said, which is the end of the poem:

Thus gratitude to God is obligatory since    She is a virgin to me while I am the previously married one

Because the beloved came into existence from non-existence, so it is a virgin, while I had loved before that, so I am previously married. If the beloved, which is the known object, when it exists does not exist in an existent characterized by will, then this love is not characterized as wanting it for itself: so it necessarily loves it for itself, like natural love. But if the beloved exists only in an existent characterized by will – such as the Real (al-Ḥaqq), may He be exalted, or a slave girl, or a boy, and there is nothing related to the love of love except what we have mentioned – then it is valid that one loves what this existent loves, in which the beloved exists only in it.

If it happens that this being does not want what this lover loves, love remains according to its principle in its love for its beloved, because its beloved has no will – as we said. So it does not follow from this that one must love what this existent loves who does not love what this lover loves, since that existent is not the essence of the beloved³, but rather it is the locus for the existence of

That Beloved, and it is not within the power of love to bring that Beloved into existence in this existent being, unless it [love] enables it [the Beloved] of itself. 
But if the Beloved is of those whose existence cannot be in an existent being, then it is not possible for it to bring the Beloved into existence at all, unless 
providential care from the Real [God] arises for it, and He gives it the power of formation, like Jesus, peace be upon him, and whomever God wills among His servants. When this is given, 
necessarily love compels him to bring his beloved into existence. This is a matter that you will not find verified as we have mentioned it
in any book other than this one, for I have not seen anyone who has verified what we have mentioned about it. Even though lovers are many—indeed, everyone
in existence is a lover—but they do not know the object of their love, and they become veiled by the existent in which their beloved manifests,
imagining that this existent is their beloved, when in reality it is merely the locus of subordination.

In reality, no one loves a beloved for the sake of the beloved itself, but rather loves it for himself. This is the verification. For
the non-existent cannot be characterized by will, so that love might love it for its sake, and abandon its own will for the will of the beloved. Since the matter in
itself is not like this, nothing remains except that one loves it for oneself. Understand this. This is pure spiritual love, stripped of natural form.

If it clothes itself in natural form and appears in it, as we said regarding divine love—and in spiritual love, this relation is closer, because it is,
in any case, a form among the forms of the world, even if it is above nature—then know that when the spirit accepts the natural form
in imaginal bodies, not in the sensory bodies that are habitually perceived (for
imaginal bodies are also habitually perceived, but not everyone who witnesses them can distinguish between them and what they consider real bodies),
this is why the Companions did not recognize Gabriel when he descended in the form of a Bedouin, and the Companions did not know
that this was an imaginal body, until the Prophet ﷺ informed them when he said to them: "This is Gabriel," and it did not occur
to them to doubt that he was an Arab. Similarly, Mary, when the angel "appeared to her as a well-proportioned human being,"¹ because she had
no sign by which to recognize spirits when they became embodied. Likewise, the Real [God] will appear to His servants on the Day of Resurrection, and they will seek refuge from Him
due to their lack of recognition of Him.

So the judgment regarding the Divine Presence and the spiritual realm in forms is the same, with respect to the ignorance of the one to whom they manifest.
Therefore, for the one whom God has providentially cared for, there must be a sign by which he knows the manifestation of the Real from the manifestation of an angel, from
the manifestation of a jinn, from the manifestation of a human being when they are given the power to appear in forms: like "the ban branch" and its like. When

# Human Beings in Their Elemental Earthly Form

Human beings in this elemental earthly constitution possess the power to transform in forms in the eye of the beholder, while remaining in their own form. Such transformation is even more accessible for spirits. Know then whom you see, what you see, and what the reality of the matter is. We have explained this in the "Chapter on Knowledge" concerning the science of imagination, so refer to it there.

When a spirit manifests in a natural form, the judgment upon it is as we described regarding Divine Love exactly, in terms of that form's receptivity to both the outward and inward, not deviating from that course. Know this. Thus, the spiritual entity combines natural and spiritual love, and love for itself and its beloved, if its beloved is, as we said, possessed of will. What we have established makes clear to you that people do not know what they love, and that their beloved is encompassed within some existent thing, so they imagine they love that existent, but this is not the case. Know the value of what I have taught you, and thank God for freeing you from ignorance of me. This amount is sufficient for the intended purpose, for it contains many branches.

Our purpose in this book is to establish fundamental principles, and praise belongs to God.

## The Third Connection: On Natural Love

It is of two types: natural and elemental. We forgot to mention the ultimate aim of spiritual love, so let us mention it in relation to natural love due to its connection with natural form. Its ultimate aim is union: that the essence of the beloved becomes identical to the essence of love, and the essence of love becomes identical to the essence of the beloved. This is what the "Incarnationists" indicate, though they have no knowledge of the reality of the matter.

Know that the natural form, in whatever state it appears—whether as a body or corporeal form, in whatever relation—the beloved (which is the non-existent, and though it is non-existent) is represented in the imagination. It thus has a type of existence that is perceived by the imaginative vision, in the imaginative presence, with the eye appropriate to it. When two lovers embrace and each one sucks the saliva of the other, and that saliva permeates the essence of each lover, and each of the two forms breathes during kissing and embracing, the breath of one enters the interior of the other, and the breath of the other enters the interior of the first.

===== page_33 =====



The animal spirit, in natural forms, is nothing but that breath, and each breath is the spirit of each one who breathes, and whoever receives it in the state of breathing and kissing is vivified by it. Thus, what was the spirit of Zayd becomes precisely the spirit of Amr, and that breath had emerged from a lover; so it took the form of love, and was accompanied by the pleasure of love. When it became a spirit in this one to whom it transferred, and the breath of the other became a spirit in this other, this was expressed as union (ittiḥād) in respect to each of the two persons, and it became valid for one to say:

I am the one whom I love, and the one whom I love is I¹

This is the ultimate aim of spiritual love in natural forms. This is what is meant in the poem at the beginning of this chapter:

Two spirits we wed, and two bodies we join

Now we return to natural love, and say: Natural love is the complete love; for all preceding forms of love, in those characterized by it, accepted natural forms according to what their realities dictated, so they were characterized in their love by what natural forms are characterized by: ecstasy (wajd), yearning (shawq), longing (ishtiyāq)², love of meeting the beloved, seeing him, and connecting with him. Many authentic reports have come concerning this that must be believed, such as his saying: "Whoever loves to meet God, God loves to meet him," despite the fact that He has never been absent from His sight, nor is it possible for Him to be absent from His sight, for He is "witness over all things"³ and watchful. Yet with this, He speaks of meeting in relation to Himself and to His servant, and describes Himself as yearning for His servants, and that He is "more intensely joyful and loving at the repentance of His servant than one whose mount has strayed—carrying his food and drink—in a barren land, then he finds it after having despaired of life and become certain of death." So how would be his joy at finding it? "God is more intensely joyful at the repentance of His servant than that person is at [finding] his mount," despite His self-sufficiency—glory be to Him—His power, and the efficacy of His will concerning His servants.

But consider⁴ the secret of His saying: "He gave everything its creation"⁵, and you will know that He did not burden matters with what they deserve, and that there is no rank above the rank of knowledge, and He has said: "The word with Me will not be changed"⁶, contrary to what is known, for its occurrence is impossible. So the matter, even if it is possible when considered in itself, is not possible when considered in relation to God's knowledge concerning it.

By the occurrence of one of the two possibilities. And the oneness of the Divine Will therein, and what the Divine Will is attached to must necessarily come into existence. And what must necessarily occur cannot be characterized as possible when considering this reality. For this reason, some of those who investigate this matter have shifted from calling it "the possible" to calling it "the necessary existent through another," which is more appropriate for verification due to the oneness of the Will. Thus He said: "And if He willed"¹ wherever He said it, and "if" is a particle of preclusion due to preclusion, so the Will has preceded with what it has preceded. As He said: "And Our word has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers"² So the name "necessary existent through another" is more complete in attributing the matter than the name "possible"; since there is only one matter³ "like the twinkling of an eye"⁴ so the probability is removed, thus possibility is removed. Therefore, there is only absolute necessity or conditioned necessity.

Then we return and say: Know that natural love, by its essence, when it resides in the lover, loves the beloved only for the enjoyment and pleasure the lover derives from it; thus he loves it for himself, not for the sake of the beloved itself. It has already been shown to you in what preceded that this reality pervades divine and spiritual love.

As for the beginning of natural love which comes from benevolence and benefaction, nature does not recognize this as a whole, but rather loves things specifically for itself: it desires connection with them and pleasure from them. This runs through every animal. And it exists in the human being insofar as he is an animal: the animal loves it in reality for the sustenance of its existence through it, not for anything else. However, it does not understand the meaning of the sustenance of its existence, but rather finds within itself a calling toward connection with a specific existence, and that connection is what it primarily loves, and this can only exist in a specific existent. So it loves that existence secondarily, not primarily. Its connection⁵ is a sensory connection and a sensory proximity. This is what we mean by "and we made bodies unite." This is the ultimate goal of natural love.

If it is sexual intercourse, it specifies its beloved in some existent, and its ultimate goal is the realization of that beloved in existence; so it seeks and yearns for the locus in which the essence of its beloved appears, and it only appears between them, not in one of them; because it is a relation between two. Likewise if it is embracing, or kissing and companionship, or whatever it may be. There is no difference between saying: nature

The thing, or its reality. All that is permissible in expressions about it.

And it is more complete in the human being than in anything else, because the human contains the realities of the world and the divine form; thus it has a relation to the Most Holy Presence, for from it he appeared, and from His saying: "Be," he came into being. And he has a relation to the spirits through his spirit, and to the world of nature and elements through his body, in terms of his constitution. Thus he loves all that is sought by the elements and nature through his essence; and this is nothing but the world of bodies, corporeal forms, and spirits. Among these are elemental bodies; and every elemental body is natural. And among them are natural bodies that are not elemental. So not every natural body is elemental. The elements are among the natural bodies and are not called "elemental," and likewise the celestial spheres and celestial beings.

For this reason we know that the Supreme Assembly disputes among themselves, thus falling under His words—Exalted is He: "And they continue to differ, except those on whom your Lord has mercy"¹ and they differ from these who receive mercy and their Creator "and for that He created them," that is, for the sake of difference He created them. Because² the divine Names are of varying degrees. From there difference emerged: Where is the Harmer compared to the Benefiter? And the Exalter compared to the Abaser? And the Constrictor compared to the Expander? And where is heat compared to cold? And where is moisture compared to dryness? And where is light compared to darkness? And where is non-existence compared to existence? And where is fire compared to water? And where is yellow bile compared to phlegm? And where is movement compared to stillness? And where is servitude compared to lordship? Are these not opposites? "They continue to differ." And where is permissibility compared to prohibition regarding the same thing for two different persons; what is forbidden to one is lawful to another, so two different rulings apply to one thing? Look at the ruling of opposing nature: from where did it emerge? And what was the cause of its existence as opposites in divine knowledge? Know that none of the created beings, other than Allah, has any command over anything, neither in this world nor in the next, to the extent that the Hereafter consists of two abodes: vision and veil. So praise be to Allah who has made clear to us matters, their sources, and their destinations. And He made us among those who know them. May Allah make us among those whom He has made happy through what He has taught them.

It has become clear to you that the beloved is connection with some existence, whether many or few. And with it being: intimacy, companionship, representation, embrace, and other things, according to what is required by the reality of the existence in which is the essence of the beloved, and according to the reality of love. So the beloved is single in essence, yet diverse; and it is the love of connection specifically: whether through conversation, or embrace, or kissing. This is its diversity in one or many. It is not valid for love to love two essentially, because

# The heart does not hear it¹.

If you say: This might be true regarding the love of the created, but not regarding the love of the Truth, for He said: "Then Allah will love you"² and thus He loved many! We say: Love's meaning is intelligible, and even if it cannot be defined, it is perceived through taste, not unknown, though difficult to conceptualize. However, its attribution to Allah the Exalted is unknown, for "There is nothing like unto Him"³. Your statement, "but not regarding the love of the Truth," is an arbitrary judgment on your part, for only one who knows the Essence of Truth would say this, and the Essence cannot be known. Therefore, the attribution cannot be known, though the general concept can be known; for He addresses His servants only in their language, and with what they understand in their language, concerning everything He attributes to Himself and describes as being His quality, though the modality of this remains unknown.

## The Excellence of (Elemental Love)

As for the second category, which is elemental love: though it is natural, there is a distinction between the two categories. This is because natural love is not confined to one natural form over another, and it relates to every form as it does to any other in love: like electricity with what it connects to and holds by its property. As for elemental love, it is that which is confined to specific natural forms alone, like Qays with Layla, Qays with Lubna, Kathir with Azza, and Jamil with Buthayna. This occurs only due to the general correspondence between them, like the magnet with iron. Its parallel in spiritual love is: "There is none among us but has a known station"⁴. Its parallel in divine love is being restricted to one creed, excluding others. Just as spiritual love resembles natural love in purity. And divine love resembles natural love in the one who sees in all creeds a single essence.

# Chapter (States of the Loving Heart)

Know that the lover—as we have said—though he has four titles, each title has a state in what is the essence of the other.
Let us clarify all of this.

## Among these is Hawā (passionate love):

It is used in two ways, both related to love. The first type is its falling into the heart, which is its manifestation from the unseen to the witnessed realm in the heart. It is said: "The star has descended (hawā)" when it falls. The Exalted says: ﴾By the star when it descends﴿¹. It is one of the names of love in that state. The verb form is hawiya, yahwā—with a kasra on the middle letter in the past tense, and a fatha in the future tense. The noun derived from it is "hawan," which is "al-hawā." This name is also the past tense of hawiy, which means falling. It is said: hawā—with a fatha on the middle letter in the past tense—yahwī with a kasra in the future tense, and the noun from it is huwiy.

The cause of the occurrence of the meaning that is hawā in the heart is one of three things, or some of them, or all of them: either a glance, or hearing, or beneficence. The greatest of these is sight, and it is the most intense: for it does not change with meeting. Hearing is not like that: for it changes with meeting. It is unlikely that what the imagination portrays through hearing will match the form² of the one mentioned. As for love of beneficence, it is caused and can be removed by forgetfulness, even with the continuance of beneficence, because the essence of beauty is not witnessed.

As for the second type of hawā, it exists only with the presence of the rule of Divine Law, and it is His saying to David: ﴾So judge between people in truth and do not follow desire [hawā]﴿³. Meaning, do not follow what you love, but follow what I love; which is judgment according to what I have ordained for you. Then He said: ﴾lest it lead you astray from the path of Allah﴿, meaning it will confuse you and destroy you and obscure from you the path which I have legislated for you, and which I have asked you to walk upon, which is to judge by it. Hawā here means what a person loves. The Truth commanded him to abandon what he loves when it opposes the prescribed path.

If you say: He has forbidden him from what cannot validly be forbidden; for love, which is hawā, has a strong authority, and rational judgment does not exist with it. We say: He did not burden him with removing hawā; for it cannot be removed. However, hawā—as we have said—differs in its object, and can exist toward many entities. We have explained that hawā, which is love, its reality

Love¹ of connection with a particular existent, or with many. So we ask from Him—Exalted is He—to attach it to the truth which He has legislated for it, namely the path of God, just as He attaches it to many paths that are not the path of God. This is the meaning of His saying: "And do not follow desire [hawā]"². He does not burden one with what one cannot bear, for imposing what cannot be borne is impossible for the Knowing, the Wise to legislate.

If you argue, using the example of imposing faith upon one who, in God's foreknowledge, will not believe, like Abu Jahl and others like him, we say:
The answer is from two perspectives: The first perspective is that I do not mean by "imposing what³ cannot be borne" except what is customarily impossible for the one obligated to bear. For example, saying to him: Ascend to heaven without means, or unite between opposites: Stand up at the moment when standing is impossible. Rather, He obligated him with what is customarily possible to bear: namely, to believe in faith, or to pronounce it. And every person finds within themselves the capability for such things: whether acquired or created, however you wish to express it.
This is why God's proof against the servant stands on the Day of Resurrection. He has said: "For God is the conclusive proof"⁴. If He had obligated him with what is not within his customary capacity, His saying: "For God is the conclusive proof" would not be valid. Rather, He would have said: God does what He wills.
As He said: "He is not questioned about what He does"⁵. This means that one cannot say to the Truth: Why have You obligated us, prohibited us, and commanded us, while knowing what You have decreed for us of disobedience to You? This is where "He is not questioned about what He does" applies, for He says to them: Did I command you with what you can bear, or with what you cannot bear according to yourselves? They must answer according to what is customary: that they can bear it. So He has obligated them with what they can bear. Thus it is established that God has the conclusive proof, for they are ignorant of God's knowledge concerning them at the time of obligation.

The second answer: It has been established that faith in Him is inevitable, and it occurs in God's grasp as adornment, and its judgment manifests in the Hereafter; so there remains only the believer. And in this worldly abode, one acknowledges His existence, and even if one associates partners [with God], one only associates with what exists. This is why He only asks for the unification of the command for Him specifically; and this is beloved to the Truth; and it is absent from them. And through the love of His unification, it becomes manifest in these existents, so even if He loves one, He loves him from among many². So whoever is characterized by it, God loves him, because His beloved, which is unification, appears in him. And whoever He detests, it is because His beloved, which is unification, does not appear in him. So all incline toward faith. We have established this in [the discussion of] the precedence of mercy over God's wrath. Thus the meaning of desire [hawā] has been made clear to you.

# As for Love:

It is when this passion (hawā) is purified in its attachment, to the path of God exclusive of all other paths. When it is purified for Him, and cleared from the impurities of partners from [other] paths, it is called love (ḥubb): due to its clarity and purity. And from this the water jar (ḥubb) in which water is placed is named, because the water becomes clear in it, and becomes pure, and its sediment settles to its bottom. Likewise love in created beings, when it attaches to the threshold of the Truth—Glory be to Him—it is purified for Him from its attachment to rivals, whom the polytheists have made partners with God in divinity. That is called love, rather the Exalted said about it: "Those who believe are more intense in love for Allah."²

The reason for this is that when the veil is lifted, "those who were followed disassociate themselves from those who followed,"³ "And those who followed will say, 'If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.'"⁴ So their love for them vanishes in that place, while the believers remain in their love for God, and they are "more intense in love for Allah" by what they have exceeded over those others, at the time of their turning away from their love for their gods, when they [their gods] did not avail them against God in anything. Thus, on the Day of Resurrection, nothing remains with the polytheists except their love for God exclusively.

For in this world they loved Him, and they loved their partners thinking them to be gods, and were it not for that delusion and error they would not have loved them. So their beloved was [the attribute of] divinity, and they imagined it in many beings; thus they loved Him and loved [their] partners. So when it is the Day of Resurrection—as we mentioned—nothing remains with them except their love for God—the Exalted—and they become in the Hereafter more intense in love for God than they were for Him in this world, because their love was divided. So it becomes united upon Him in the Hereafter when they do not witness their beloved, which is divinity, except in Him exclusively. This is why mercy precedes, and the two extremes are strong, while the intermediary is weak due to the polytheism within it. We have explained all of this in what preceded. This is the difference between love (ḥubb) and passion (hawā).

# As for Ardent Love (ʿishq):

It is the excess of love or excessive love, and it is His saying about those who believe: "more intense in love for Allah." And with its purity, if one were to take that which is called love, and its manifestation in the grain of the heart which is also named after it, it is called love. But when a person is overwhelmed by carrying it, and it blinds him to everything other than his beloved, and that reality permeates all parts of his body, his faculties, and his spirit, and it flows within him like blood in his veins and flesh, and it inundates all his joints; so it connects with his existence, and embraces all his parts; body and spirit, and no space remains in him for other than it, and his speech becomes through it, and his radiance

from him, and his gaze in everything is toward Him, and he sees Him in every form, and he does not see anything without saying: "He is this"; at that point such love is called passionate love ('ishq). As was related about¹ Lumay'a that when she was bled, the blood fell on the ground and inscribed with it "Yusuf, Yusuf" in many places where the blood fell, due to the mention of his name flowing like blood through all her veins. Similarly, it was related about al-Hallaj that when his limbs were cut off, his blood inscribed on the ground "Allah, Allah" wherever it fell. And for this reason he said, may God have mercy on him:

No tissue or joint of mine exists
Except that within it is Your remembrance

This belongs to this category. These are the passionate lovers who are consumed in love to this degree of consumption, which is called infatuation (gharam), and mention of it will come in the description of lovers—God willing.

As for affection (wudd):

It is the firmness of love or passionate love or desire, whichever state it may be among the states of this attribute. When the one characterized by it remains steadfast in it, and nothing changes him from it, nor removes him from its authority, and its dominion over him remains firm in both agreeable and disagreeable circumstances, in what displeases and pleases, and in the state of separation and rejection from the being in whom one wants one's beloved to manifest, and he remains under his authority because he is the manifestation of his beloved—this is called affection (wudd). And this is referenced in His words—Exalted is He: "The Most Merciful will appoint for them affection (wuddan)"² meaning a special status in Paradise with God and in the hearts of His servants. This is the meaning of affection.

And love³ has very many states among lovers, which I shall mention—God willing—such as: longing, infatuation, intense love, passionate attachment, weeping, sadness, grief, withering, brokenness, and similar things that lovers are characterized by and mention in their poetry, the details of which—God willing.

Many misconceptions occur in love. The greatest of them is what we have mentioned: that they imagine the beloved to be something existential, whereas it is something non-existential that love relates to, wanting to see it existing in an existing entity. When one sees it, one's love shifts to the permanence of that state which one loved to exist in that existing entity, so the beloved remains perpetually non-existent, though most lovers are not aware of this unless they are knowers of realities and their relations. We have explained this.

Most of our discourse in this chapter is about excessive love, for it takes away reason, or causes

===== page_41 =====


Transformation, constant thought, persistent concern, anxiety, sleeplessness, yearning, longing, insomnia, change of condition, eclipse of mind, bewilderment, stupefaction, and having ill thoughts about the beloved—I mean the existent wherein you love the manifestation of your beloved, which the common people claim is the beloved itself.

We are of two types regarding this: One group among us beholds the image that exists in their imagination of that existent wherein their beloved is manifested, and witnesses the existence of their beloved through connection with it in their imagination. Thus, they witness it connected to them in a subtle connection, more subtle than its form in external existence. This is what preoccupied Qays the Madman away from Layla¹ when she came to him in person, and he said to her: "Away from me!" lest the density of her sensory form veil him from the subtlety of this imaginal contemplation, for she is more subtle and more beautiful in his imagination than in his physical sight. This is the most subtle form of love. The possessor of this quality remains in continual bliss, never complaining of separation.

In this quality, we possess the upper hand among lovers, for such a state is rare among lovers due to the predominance of density in them. The reason for this, in our view, is that one who is immersed in the love of meanings abstracted from material forms will, at most, when densifying them, bring them down to the imagination, and no further. So what do you think of one whose most unveiled state is the imagination—what of their capacity regarding pure meanings? One whose condition is such is capable of loving God, for the utmost in loving Him, if not stripped of anthropomorphism, is to bring Him down to the imagination. This is the meaning of the Prophet's saying ﷺ: "Worship God as though you see Him." When we, possessing this quality, love an existent wherein we love the manifestation of our beloved, (and it is) from the sensory realm of dense forms, we subtilize it by elevating it to the imagination to clothe it in our beauty beyond its own beauty, and place it in a presence where separation and displacement are impossible; thus it remains in perpetual connection. And in this regard we have:

Majnun of 'Amir has nothing in his passion    
Save complaints of distance and estrangement
But I am his opposite, for my beloved    
Is in my imagination, so I remain in constant proximity
My beloved is with me, in me, and by me    
So why should I say "what ails me" and "what ails me"?

As for our saying, "Love takes away reason," they have said:

There is no good in love managed by reason

And Abu al-'Abbas al-Mara'i al-Kisa'i said: "Love has more power over souls than reason does."

They said this because the intellect constrains its possessor, while love is characterized by bewilderment and confusion. Bewilderment contradicts the intellect; for the intellect gathers you together while bewilderment scatters you. The brothers of Joseph said to Jacob: "Truly, you are in your old error"¹ meaning his bewilderment in love for Joseph, and bewilderment scatters and does not gather. This is why love is described as "scattering" (bathth), which is the dispersion of love's concerns in many directions. The Exalted said: "And from them both scattered many men and women"² and likewise His saying: "scattered dust"³. Love is under the authority of the beloved, having no self-determination, but rather is governed by what the authority of love, which has taken possession of his heart, gives and commands him. Among the lover's bewilderment in his love is that he imagines that everyone finds his beloved beautiful, and that they see in the beloved what this lover sees, and this is from bewilderment. And according to this runs the proverb:

"Beautiful, in every eye, is the one you love"

Meaning that you—O lover—imagine that everyone who sees your beloved finds them beautiful, just as you do.

Among the bewilderment of the lover is that he becomes confused about the ways through which he thinks he can attain his beloved, saying: "Should I do this to reach my beloved through this action?! Or this and that?!" He remains bewildered about which approach to take, because he imagines that the pleasure of experiencing his beloved in the senses is greater than in the imagination, and this is due to the predominance of density in this lover. He neglects the pleasure of imagination during sleep, which is more intense than his pleasure in imagination [while awake], because it connects more intensely with it than imagination [while awake]. And the connection with imagination is stronger than the connection with the external, which is the sensory. For in meaning, the connection is stronger than in imagination. So the lover becomes bewildered in determining the approaches by which he can reach connection from the outside, and he asks about this from someone he knows has experience in this matter, hoping to find some stratagem for it, especially when he has heard the saying:

"If your passion were true, you would be guided to stratagems"
meaning in what you might do to connect with the beloved.

# The Attributes of Lovers

The first thing I shall mention regarding the attributes of lovers is what was narrated to us by Yunus ibn Yahya ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Hashimi al-Abbasi al-Qassar in Mecca, facing the Yemeni corner of the venerated Ka'ba, in the year five hundred and ninety-nine. He said: Ibn Abd al-Baqi informed us, Ahmad ibn Ahmad informed us, Ahmad ibn Abdullah informed us, Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far narrated to us, Abu Bakr al-Dinawari the Reciter narrated to us, in the year two hundred and eighty-eight, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shamsati narrated to us, saying: I heard Dhul-Nun saying:

"Verily, Allah has servants whose hearts He has filled with the pure clarity of His love, and He has opened their spirits with longing for His vision. Glory be to Him who has made their souls yearn for Him, drawn their understanding near to Him, and constricted their breasts for Him. Glory be to the One who is their support, the companion in their solitude, and the physician of their ailments. My God! To You their bodies have humbled themselves, and toward seeking more of You their hands have stretched forth. You have made them taste the sweetness of understanding You, which has made their lives pleasant and perpetuated their attributes. You have opened for them the doors of Your heavens and permitted their hearts to wander in Your dominion. Indeed, You have not forgotten the love of the lovers, and upon You rests the reliance of the yearning ones' longing. To You the hearts of the knowers have inclined, and with You the hearts of the truthful have found intimacy. Upon You the fear of the fearful has focused, and in You the hearts of the moderate have sought refuge. Rest emanates from their weariness, and heedlessness has little ambition in them. They do not settle into the deception of thought regarding what does not concern them, nor do they cease from toil and vigilance. They converse intimately with Him with their tongues and implore Him with their neediness, asking Him for pardon for their slips and forgiveness for what errors have occurred in their actions. They are those whose hearts have melted with contemplation of sorrows, and they have served Him with the service of the righteous."

# Among their attributes ﷺ is Acceptance:

This is an attribute related to their hidden aspects and subtle faculties. As for its connection to their subtle faculties: the spirits of lovers—though they are too subtle to be perceived by the senses or captured by imagination—love makes them subtle like the mirage, in terms of its effect. This is because the mirage "the thirsty one thinks is water" and that is its subtlety; were it not for this, he would not think it water, because water is the object of his need. So he turns to it because it is his desire and his beloved, due to the secret of life contained within it. "But when he comes to it, he finds it to be nothing," and when he finds it to be nothing, "he finds Allah with him," as a substitute for the water. Thus his intention in seeking the water was good.

2 p. 152
3 [al-Nur: 39]

===== page_44 =====



And God intends by it [to lead him] to Himself, from where he perceives not. Just as He—the Exalted—schemes with the servant from where he perceives not, likewise He attends to the servant in his seeking refuge in Him, returning to Him, and relying upon Him: by cutting off the means from him even as He displays them to him, from where he perceives not.

So finding God with him, when the water imagined in the mirage is lost, is his return to God. When the means are cut off from him, and the doors to what he seeks are closed, he returns to the One in whose hand is the dominion of all things, and this was what God sought from him. This is His action with His beloved ones: He returns them to Himself through both necessity and choice.

Likewise, their spirits: they reckon them as fulfilling the rights of God which He has imposed upon them, and that they are acting by God's command, out of love for God and yearning for His pleasure, so that He may see them where He has commanded them to be. But when the veil is lifted for them, and their sight becomes clear, they find themselves like the mirage in the form of water: they see none upholding the rights of God except the Creator of actions, who is God the Exalted.

They find God to be the very essence of what they imagined to be their own essence, so their essence disappears from Him, and¹ the witnessed Truth remains by the eye of Truth, just as the water of the mirage vanishes from the mirage, though the mirage itself remains visible, but is not water. Similarly, the spirit exists in itself, but is not an actor. Thus it knows at that point that the lover is the essence of the Beloved, and that it has loved none other than Him, and it cannot be otherwise. And there can be no transformation in spirits more subtle than this.

As for the type of transformation related to their density, it is what the senses perceive of the changes in their colors, and the wasting away of the flesh of their bodies due to the dominance of their thoughts circling around performing what the Beloved has charged them to perform, of what He has imposed upon them. So they exert² their utmost effort to be characterized by fulfillment of covenants; as they had covenanted with God regarding this, and bound themselves to it in their faith in Him and His Messenger, and they heard Him saying commandingly: "O you who believe, fulfill the contracts,"³ and He said: "And fulfill the covenant of God when you have covenanted, and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made God over you a guarantor."⁴ This is the cause of the thinning of their bodies.

And among the characteristics of lovers is withering:

And it is a genuine attribute in their spirits and bodies. As for their bodies, its cause is abandoning the delights of appetizing foods

which have richness and moisture, and are pleasurable to the souls, and bestow upon the bodies the freshness¹ of blessings. When they saw that the Beloved tasked them with standing before Him and conversing with Him at night during His manifestation while others sleep, and they observed that the moisture accumulated in their bodies produced vapors that rise to the brain, numbing the senses and overwhelming them, causing sleep to overcome them despite their souls' desire to stand before their Beloved for intimate discourse in their seclusion while others sleep.

Then, these vapors produce strength in their bodies, leading their limbs to indulge in excesses which their Beloved had forbidden them. So they abandoned food and drink except for what was absolutely necessary: thus moisture decreased in their bodies, the freshness of comfort departed from them, their lips withered, their bodies became languid, their sleep departed, and their wakefulness strengthened. They thereby achieved their purpose of standing before Him, and found assistance in this through what they had abandoned. This is the withering of bodies.

As for the withering of their spirits, they had an inclination toward knowledge and sciences, due to their relation to the spirits of the Highest Assembly, seeking comfort in their own kind and desiring mutual assistance, when they heard God Almighty say: "And cooperate in righteousness and piety." They imagined they were the ones addressed by this, but this is not the case. For those addressed by this² are those who might cooperate in sin and transgression, which is why He followed it with a prohibition, saying: "And do not cooperate in sin and aggression, and fear Allah."³ This is not among the attributes of the Highest Assembly.

When they recognized their error in this, they turned from this verse to His saying: "Seek help through Allah and be patient,"⁴ meaning, confine yourselves with God. When they separated from their kind through this verse, their spirits withered, after having been in the freshness of bliss through companionship with their kind, because they attached themselves to One of whom "There is nothing like unto Him."⁵ They found no resemblance-based relationship between themselves and Him to which they could attach. So knowledge said to them: God only addresses you in your own tongue, language, and dialect, and according to what the people of that language, among whom you are counted, have agreed upon. Return to the understood meaning of what He has addressed you with, for He has not removed it from the reality of its signification, and you will not, through your ignorance, attain relation to Him through this. For that attribute with which He has addressed you, by which you seek Him, is how He has described Himself, and His attributes only exist through a special correspondence between us and Him.

When you become attached to that attribute, and by necessity cling to it, it moistens you in His presence, so you come to know the form of its relation to Him—a knowledge of taste and divine manifestation. Thus your withering increases until you become like an imaginary point. As one of them said:

I became in You, from emaciation,    Like an imaginary point

This is¹ that which has no existence except in imagination. So this one perishes in withering. We have related, in a report supported by unveiling, that Israfil, peace be upon him, who is among the most elevated of celestial spirits, "diminishes himself each day, due to the dominance of God's magnificence over his heart, seventy times, until he becomes like the wagtail²," just as the arrogant who magnify themselves over God's servants will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like tiny ants; in humiliation and smallness, because of how they appeared in this world with self-aggrandizement and pride. This is the description of their withering in their spirits and bodies.

Among the attributes of lovers is also passionate love (gharām):

It is the consumption in the Beloved through the constant companionship of the liver. The Exalted said: ﴾Indeed, its punishment is ever-persistent [gharāman]﴾³ meaning destructive, due to the persistent witnessing of the Beloved. For the gharim is one who is obligated by debt, and thus it is called gharam. Its inversion is also: raghām, which means adhering to dust. For raghām (is) dust. It is said: "his nose is in the dust," as the nose is the site of honor, so with raghām in supplication they pressed it to the dust. Thus gharām governs what is binding from the sought, and it is characterized by humility, for dust is the most lowly of the lowly. For this reason, the earth is described as "subservient" as a form of hyperbole, because the most humble are upon its surface. And since love adheres to the hearts of lovers, and longing to the hearts of the yearning, and sleeplessness to the souls of the wakeful, and every⁴ attribute of the lover describes him; the possessor of all these persistent states is called mughram, and his quality is called "gharām." It is a name that encompasses all that adheres to the lover from the attribute of love, for the lover has no attribute more encompassing than gharām.

Among the attributes of lovers is longing (shawq):

It is a spiritual movement toward meeting the Beloved, and a natural, physical, sensory movement toward meeting the Beloved, when the Beloved shares his form. When he meets the Beloved—whichever beloved it may be—he experiences stillness within movement, and becomes perplexed: why does that movement return despite the presence of the meeting? And why does it increase, and with it he experiences fear in the state of union? He finds

===== page_47 =====



Fear is connected to the anticipation of separation, and you find that the movement of longing seeks the perpetuation of the state of union, and thus it is stirred by continuance. As it was said regarding longing¹:

The most intense longing comes on the day
When one dwelling approaches another dwelling

And another said, concerning what we mentioned about fear in the state of union²:

Indeed, when they are distant, I feel longing for them
And when they are near, I fear separation

This is the recompense of one who loves other than his own essence, and places the existence of his beloved in what is external to him. Had he loved Allah, this would not have been his state. For the lover of Allah does not fear separation from Him, and how could a thing separate from what is inherent to it, while it is in His grasp, and wherever his Beloved sees him³, and He is "closer to him than his jugular vein"⁴, "And you did not throw when you threw, but it was Allah who threw"⁵.

Where is separation, when there is nothing in existence except Him?

Allah, the Exalted, says: "Whoever draws near to Me by a span, I draw near to him by a cubit." The hadith.

This is how you should understand—O my brother—the worth of one who loves you: for Allah's sake, or for his own sake. If the Truth, despite His independence from the world, when His servant loves Him, hastens to unite with him, adorns him, brings him near, and makes him among His special companions—then you are more worthy of this attribute. When someone loves you, he has given you sovereignty over him and made himself a place for your control. It is fitting for you, if you are rational, to recognize the value of love and the value of one who loves you, and to hasten to connect with him, adopting the characteristics of Allah with His beloved, for whoever has bestowed upon you his love has a claim upon you that you can never fully repay.

This is because everything you do out of love after his initial gesture toward you is merely a result of that love with which you were first loved.

Among the attributes of lovers is bewilderment (huyām):

They are the bewildered ones who wander aimlessly, without intending a specific direction. And the lovers of Allah are most deserving

With this attribute. For one who loves the created being, when he wanders aimlessly, it is due to his anxiety and despair of attaining union with his beloved. 
But the love of God is certain of union, and he knows that God—glory be to Him—is not confined, nor limited to a specific place to be sought there; because
the reality of the Truth refuses such limitation. Therefore He said: "Wherever you turn, there is the Face of God"¹ and He said: "He is with you wherever
you may be"² So his love pervades every valley and every state; because his beloved is the Truth, so he does not seek Him in a specific direction; rather
He manifests to him in whatever purpose he intends, in whatever state he may be. Thus they are more deserving of the quality of wandering love than those who love created beings. He
—the Exalted—is witnessed by the lovers in every eye, mentioned by every tongue, and heard from every speaker. This is how
the knowers have known Him, and with this reality He has revealed Himself to the lovers.

Among the attributes of the lover are: sighs (zafarat):

They are a burning light-fire, which the heart is too constrained to contain; so they emerge intensified due to the accumulation of what the lover experiences in
the liver. Their emergence produces a sound of extremely hot breath, just as fire produces a sound, and this
sound is called: a sigh (zafra). This occurs only in the natural body specifically, though it may also occur in the embodied form.

For this reason, the embodied form of the abstract meaning—when it appears within it, and it is said: "this is its form"—is characterized by anger
and pleasure, like natural bodies. As he ﷺ said about himself: "I am only a human being. I become angry as humans become angry
and I am pleased as humans are pleased."

When the Divine Presence, of which "There is nothing like unto Him"³, has described Himself with pleasure and anger⁴ in
these two attributes, and in similar attributes with which the Truth has described Himself, and from that reality they appeared in the world, and for this
we say: God's—glory be to Him—knowledge of Himself is His knowledge of the world, it cannot be otherwise. Thus every reality that appears in
the world, and every attribute, has a divine origin to which it returns. Were it not for that divine origin preserving its existence, it would neither
exist nor persist. None know this except a few individuals among the people of God, for it is a specialized knowledge. The Exalted said:
"And God's anger is upon him"⁵ Then there came in the report what is more severe than this for whoever comprehends God's meaning, which is what is related
in the authentic hadith from the saying of the Prophets on the Day of Resurrection: "Indeed God has become angry today with an anger the like of which He has never been angry

like it, and never after it will there be anger like it." This is more severe than that, as His anger is characterized by occurrence and cessation. And in that station, Muhammad ﷺ says regarding those among his companions who changed after him: "Away with them, away with them," as required by the condition and context. For the master of governance conducts his judgments according to conditions and contexts.

Among the attributes of lovers is grief (kamad):

It is the most intense sorrow of the heart, with which no tears flow, except that its possessor sighs and heaves frequently. It is a sorrow one finds within oneself, not over something lost or any shortcoming. This is the unknown sorrow¹ that is among the attributes of lovers, having no cause except love² specifically. It has no remedy except union with the beloved; then preoccupation with the beloved distracts one from the feeling of grief.

If physical union with the beloved does not occur, then the beloved becomes present through what he commands, and carrying out his commands and rejoicing in that distracts from the grief. Grief is most intense when there is nothing between the lover and the beloved to distract the lover from himself, and the lover has no attribute that disappears with preoccupation except grief.

The attributes of love are numerous, such as: regret, bewilderment, astonishment, confusion, perplexity, jealousy, vigilance, illness, anxiety, generosity, weeping, torment, ecstasy, sleeplessness, and what the impassioned have mentioned in their poetry about this.

Our discourse in this chapter concerns specifically God's love for His servants, and the servants' love for God, nothing else. God—glory be to Him—has mentioned peoples whom He loves for qualities they possess, for which He loved them. Just as He has withdrawn His love from peoples for qualities they possess. He mentioned this in His Book and through the tongue of His Messenger ﷺ.

# In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful

(The Qualities That People Possessed and for Which Allah Detested Them)

(Following):

Among these is following the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, in what he has prescribed. The Exalted said: "Say [O Muhammad]: 'If you love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you.'"² Know that Allah has two kinds of love, or two attachments: His love for His servants, which is a specific will. The first attachment: His initial love for them, through which He guides them to follow—follow His messengers, peace be upon all of them—then this following produces for them an attachment of love; because following occurs in two ways: from the perspective of performing obligatory duties.

And the other attachment comes from adhering to supererogatory acts. He (peace be upon him) said in what he narrates from his Lord, the hadith which contains: "My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the performance of what I have made obligatory upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory acts until I love him. And when I love him, I become his hearing, his sight, his hand, and his support." When the Real becomes the servant's hearing and faculties in supererogatory acts, then how about the love that comes from the Real to him through performing obligatory duties? It is that the Real wills with the will of this chosen servant, and grants him authority in the cosmos according to what he wishes, through His—the Exalted's—eternal will by which He guided him. This attachment is subsumed within the first, which is His saying: "But you cannot will except as Allah wills."³

Every quality that the Real mentioned that He loves the one who possesses it, that quality is only attained through following. For the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, established its practice, and that is from Allah, for "He does not speak from desire"⁴ and indeed it is done with him and with us, so it is denied that the action belongs to him, but rather as some see it, which is His saying: "I do not know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow what is revealed to me, and I am only a clear warner."⁶ This is His saying: "The duty of the Messenger is only to convey the message."⁷

The meaning of following is that we do what he tells us; if he says: "Follow me in my action," we follow him, and if he does not say so, then what is obligatory upon us is to follow what he says. Thus, following in what he commanded us and what he prohibited us from, and observing his limits, produces for us...

to follow Him in His actions with His creation, which are called karāma (miracle) and āya (sign), that is, a sign of the truthfulness of the followers. The messengers are also followers, for he ﷺ says: "I follow only what is revealed to me." So what manifests in him from following God's action, as a result of his following God's commands, is a sign (āya), and for us it is a miracle (karāma); and it is action with difficulty, and orientation without direct engagement.

Thus there appears at the hand of this servant, in terms of breaking habits, that which should not be—except in that manner, without any cause other than mere will—except for God the Exalted. For that action, when it appears from an apparent, manifest cause, is not of this category, like the flight of a bird by obvious means, even though only God sustains it, that is, God who established for it the means of being sustained in the air. When a human traverses the air and walks in it—by mere will, not by customary apparent means—it resembles the action of the Truth in creating things by will. This is the distinction between it and what occurs through causes. Its foundation is: realization through following. What is followed in legislation is only God, and what is followed in action by will is only God, and all is by God's providence and will. "There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise."²

* * *

And from that is His right—glory be to Him—the Oft-Returning (al-Tawwāb):

The Oft-Returning (al-Tawwāb) is His attribute and among His names, the Exalted. He ﷺ says: "Indeed, Allah is the Oft-Returning"⁴ He loves only His name and His attribute, and He loves the servant for being characterized by it, but only when he is characterized by it according to how the Truth has attributed it to him.

This is because the Truth returns to His servant in every state in which the servant finds himself that distances him from God, and he is the wrongdoer through sin, disobedience, and opposition. So when the servant wrongs someone to whom he has done evil, from among his likes and peers, and then returns to him with kindness and overlooking his wrongdoing—that is the Oft-Returning (al-Tawwāb), not the one who returns to God. For it is not valid to return to God except for one who maintains that God is with him in every state. And the Truth did not address with His saying:

﴿You shall return therein to Allah﴾¹ except for one who is heedless of Allah being with him in every state. As He said: ﴿And He is with you wherever you may be﴾² ﴿And We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein﴾³. So if you return to Him, in terms of reckoning or questioning, this is in reality a return from a state you are in to a state you are not in. And since all states are in the hand of Allah, the return is attributed to Allah in this way. Thus, the one returning to Allah is only returning from opposition to accordance, and from disobedience to obedience. This is the meaning of the love for those who constantly repent.

If you are among those who constantly repent toward those who wrong you, Allah will be ever-returning to you regarding what you have done wrong in His right, and He will return to you with benevolence. Thus you will know the realities of matters, understand the meanings of Allah's address to His servants, and distinguish between ranks; you will be among those who have knowledge of Allah and what He has said. The mention of this garden comes in the context of those who constantly repent following the mention of the harm that He placed in menstruation.

Likewise, he ﷺ said: "Indeed Allah loves every tested one who constantly repents"—meaning one who is tested⁵, whom Allah wants to test through those of Allah's servants who wrong him, and who returns to them with benevolence in response to their wrongdoing. This is the constantly repentant one—not that Allah tests His servants with sins. Allah is far above having such a thing attributed to Him, even though all actions belong to Allah insofar as they are actions, and they are only sins insofar as Allah has judged them to be so. All Allah's actions are good insofar as they are actions, so understand this.

And among that is His love for those who purify themselves:

The Exalted said: ﴿And He loves those who purify themselves﴾⁶. Purification is an attribute of sanctification and transcendence, and it is His attribute, the Exalted. The purification of the servant is⁷ that he removes from himself every harm that is not befitting for him to be seen with, even if it is praiseworthy

In relation to other than Himself¹, and it is blameworthy according to the Law in relation to Him. When one purifies himself from this, God—Exalted is He—loves him:
Like pride, might, boasting², haughtiness, and self-admiration.

These attributes do not enter the heart all at once due to the divine seal³ upon hearts, which is His saying, Exalted is He:
"Thus does God seal every heart of one who is proud, tyrannical⁴." So pride and might appear outwardly toward those who deserve it among his people; either in his opinion and imagination, or in reality, while in his heart he is protected from that pride and might, because he knows his incapacity, lowliness, and need for all existents. And that the flea intends him harm, and the lavatory is sought to remove the pain of urine and heat from him, and he needs a piece of bread to repel the pain of hunger from himself. How can one whose condition is like this every day and night possibly have pride and might in his heart? This is the divine seal upon his heart, so none of that enters it.

As for the manifestation of these traits in his outward form, this is granted, but God has appointed situations where one may exhibit these qualities without being blameworthy, and situations where He condemns them. Whoever purifies himself from having these attributes seen upon him outside their proper contexts is purified, and God loves him. Just as He denies His love for "every vainglorious boaster⁵," for no one manifests this attribute except one who is⁶ ignorant, and ignorance is blameworthy. For this reason⁷, God prohibited His Prophet ﷺ from being ignorant.
And He said to Noah, peace be upon him: "I admonish you lest you be among the ignorant⁸." For one cannot avoid either boasting over his like, or over his Lord and Creator. If he boasts over his like, he has boasted over himself, and a thing does not boast over itself; thus his boasting and arrogance are ignorance. And it is impossible that he would boast over his Creator, because he must either know his Creator, or not know that he has a Creator. If he knows and still boasts over Him, then he is ignorant of what qualities of perfection his Creator should have, and if he does not know, then he is ignorant. So God dislikes him and does not love him only because of his ignorance. As this was not in other

...his homeland except due to his ignorance, and ignorance is death, and knowledge is life. This is [the meaning of] His saying, exalted is He: "Is one who was dead and We gave him life"¹ 
meaning through knowledge, "and made for him a light by which to walk among the people"¹ and that is the light of faith and unveiling which God has revealed to him, or bestowed upon him as a favor. So let him purify himself from such attributes, [and he will be] beloved to God, therefore understand.

* * *

And of that is His love for those who purify:

God, exalted is He, says: "And God loves those who purify themselves"² They are those who purify others just as they purify themselves, so their purification extends to others, and in this they stand in the place of the Truth as His deputies; for He is the true Purifier, the Preserver, the Protector, the Defender, and the Forgiver.

Whoever prevents himself and others from engaging in what is blameworthy in God's sight has protected, preserved, defended, and veiled them from such things. Thus he is a purifier through what he has taught of beneficial knowledge, so that—through the light of faith and its life—the darkness of ignorance and its death may flee. This will be in his balance on the Day of Resurrection, and among the lights that will proceed before him, and he is beloved to God, distinguished by divine care, divine friendship, and vicegerency. The governors and deputies are among those drawn near whom God has appointed as vicegerents over them, for they are specifically intended by the One who appointed them, not others. Every person is a governor over his limbs, and beyond that. God has informed him of what constitutes the purification with which he may purify those under his care.

And of that is His love for the patient:

This is His saying: "And God loves the patient"³ They are those whom God has tested and who have restrained themselves from complaining to anyone other than God who sent down this trial upon them. "They did not weaken due to what afflicted them in the way of God, nor did they falter"⁴ in bearing it because they bore it through God, even if it was difficult for them, which is inevitable. If it were not difficult for them, it would not be a trial. "Nor

They humbled themselves to other than Allah in removing it, and they took refuge with Allah in removing it. And they said as the righteous servant said: "Harm has afflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful."¹ Thus he raised his complaint to Him, not to anyone else, and Allah praised him that He found him patient: "How excellent a servant! Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning [to Allah]."² Along with this complaint.

This indicates that the patient one complains to Allah, not to others. Rather, this is obligatory for him, for what exists in patience, if he does not complain⁴ to Allah, of resistance to divine subjugation, which is bad etiquette with Allah. And the prophets—peace be upon them—are people of etiquette, and they have knowledge from Allah. For you know that your patience was only through Allah, not from yourself, nor from your own power and strength. For Allah says: "And be patient, and your patience is only through Allah."⁵ So by what thing do you boast, when it is not yours? Allah only tests His servants so that they may take refuge in Him for the removal of that affliction, and not take refuge in anyone else for its removal. When they do this, they are among the patient, and this is beloved to Allah.

Among His—Exalted is He—descriptive names is "the Patient" (al-Ṣabūr). He loves only those in whom He sees His own character trait. Then there is a secret here, in which He has established you in His station, for patience only occurs in response to harm, and we know that among His creation are those who harm Allah and His Messenger. He has pointed them out to us for our awareness, so we repel that harm from Him—Exalted is He—by fighting them, or by teaching them if they are ignorant yet seeking knowledge. He has named Himself Patient (Ṣabūr), and He has raised to us what harm comes to Him and made us aware of those [who cause it] so that we may defend Him and repel the harm, while [He maintains] the attribute of the Patient One. This is so we may know that when we complain to Him about what affliction has descended, and ask Him to remove it from us, our asking Him does not remove from us the name of patience, so His love for us does not cease, just as the name al-Ṣabūr (the Patient) did not cease from Him when He informed us who harmed Him so that⁶ we might defend Him. For it is related in the authentic tradition: "No one is more patient with harm than Allah." So pay attention to what we have pointed out to you.

# On the Love of the Grateful Ones:

The Real has described Himself in His Book as loving those who are grateful, and gratitude is His attribute, for He is "Appreciative, All-Knowing."¹ He only loves from the servant that which is His own attribute and quality. Gratitude can only be for blessings, not for tribulation, as some claim who have no knowledge of realities. This is because the Exalted has manifested His blessing within His vengeance, and His vengeance within His blessing. Thus, there is confusion for those who have no knowledge of realities—that is, the realities of the matter—leading them to imagine that they are grateful for tribulation, which is incorrect.

Like one who drinks unpleasant medicine—which is part of tribulation—but it is a tribulation only for the one who would perish by it, namely the illness for which it is used. Pain is the enemy of this medicine and what it seeks to eliminate. But when tribulation befalls the subject experiencing pain, and the antagonist that seeks to remove it from existence arrives—which is the medicine—the subject finds this unpleasant, yet knows that within this unpleasantness lies a blessing, for it is what removes the pain. Thus, he gives thanks to God, the Exalted, for the blessing contained therein, and endures with patience what he dislikes about using it, knowing that it targets that pain to eliminate it, seeking only the comfort of this subject. So be attentive to this.

For this reason he is grateful, and when he gives thanks for the hidden blessing within this unpleasant thing², He increases him with another blessing, which is well-being and the removal of illness and the victory of the unpleasant medicine over it. Therefore He says: "If you are grateful, I will surely increase you."³ Thus He increases him with well-being. Similarly, when the Real is harmed, and we strive to remove that which causes harm by harming or reviling it until it ceases the action that was harming the Real. If we have harmed this harmful entity through reviling and the like, this is for the Real like drinking medicine that the sick person dislikes in the moment, yet sees as a blessing because it removes that harmful matter.

We say this because everything stems from His action, decree, and determination. God revealed to His prophet David: "Build Me a house"—meaning the Holy House [Jerusalem]. He prepared to build it, but it collapsed. Then his Lord revealed to him: "It shall not be established by your hands, for you have shed blood." He replied: "O Lord, that was only in Your cause." He said: "You have spoken truly, it was

Except in My way; and with this, are they not My servants? This House shall not be built except by a hand purified from bloodshed." So he said: "O Lord, let it be from me." So God revealed to him: "It shall be built by the hand of your son Solomon." So Solomon, peace be upon him, built it.

This is precisely what I have alerted you to, if you are alert. From here you know the matter as it truly is, and that the divine matter is always built upon "He," not "he." If you do not know it, we were what you knew: "And you did not throw when you threw, but it was Allah who threw"¹. This is exactly what we said, that it is "He," not "he." And here the intellects of those who have not witnessed realities as they truly are become bewildered.

When the servant removed this² harm from the divine presence, even though it involved what is involved in taking medicine, God thanked him for that. And gratitude demands increase. So the Glorified One, through His gratitude, asked His servants to increase Him, so they increased Him in deeds, which is expressed in his (peace be upon him) saying: "Should I not be a grateful servant?" So he increased in worship, out of gratitude for God's gratitude to him. So the Real increased in guidance and success in the realm of deeds, extending even to the Hereafter, where there is neither work nor pain for the fortunate ones.

As for the indication regarding the use of disliked medicine in removing harm from God, the Real has clarified this in His saying about taking the soul of His believing servant, describing Himself—Exalted is He—as: "disliking to cause distress to His servant because the servant dislikes death, yet it is inevitable for him," while describing Himself as disliking that. This is exactly like the aversion felt by the sick person when drinking medicine, because the station of knowledge necessitates this. Therefore, the occurrence of something contrary to what is known is impossible.

The existence of the world is necessary according to what the divine realities dictate. And how far is possibility from necessity? So steady your heart, and know that "Allah is Appreciative, Knowing"³. He followed His description of Himself as grateful with His description as knowing, so increase in your deeds and you will have reciprocated your Lord for His gratitude to you for what you have done for Him. And that deed is fasting, for it is for Him. And repelling harm from Him, which is His saying: "Have you afflicted for My sake a friend of Mine or shown enmity for My sake to My enemy?" And it is His saying: "My love has become obligatory

# My love is for those who love one another for My sake, those who visit one another for My sake, those who sit together for My sake, and those who give to one another for My sake." And may God make us among those upon whom He has bestowed favor, so that we see God's favor upon us¹ in every state, and thus give thanks.

* * *

## Among that is the Love for Those Who Do Good:

This is His saying: "And God loves those who do good."² Doing good (iḥsān) is His attribute, and He is the most beautiful in form; thus His attribute is most beloved, and it is that which is manifest in His essence. The doing good by which a servant is called a doer of good (muḥsin) is "to worship God as if you see Him," meaning to worship Him through direct witnessing. And God's doing good is the station of His seeing His servants in their movements and actions. This is His saying: "Indeed, He is Witness over all things,"³ and "He is with you wherever you are."⁴ His witnessing of everything is His doing good, for by His witnessing He preserves it from perishing. Thus every state in which the servant is turned about is from God's doing good, as He—exalted is He—is the one who moves him. For this reason, bestowal of favor is called doing good, for none bestows favor upon you intentionally except one who possesses. And whoever's knowledge is identical to his seeing is a doer of good continuously. For He sees you continuously, because He knows you continuously. And doing good in the religious law is only this. And he [the Prophet] said to him: "For if you do not see Him, truly He sees you," meaning if you are not doing good, He is the doer of good.

This is the Prophet's ﷺ teaching to Gabriel in the presence of the Companions, from the category of their saying: "I mean you, so listen, O neighbor." The one addressed is not the intended recipient of that knowledge, for he already knows it. Rather, those intended by it are those present among the listeners. This is how the Messenger of God ﷺ explained it, saying in this hadith: "This is Gabriel, who came to teach⁵ people their religion."

## Among that is the Love for Those Who Fight in God's Path, with a Specific Attribute:

Translation from Ibn Arabi's text:

...gaps enter it, for gaps in the rows are pathways for devils. And the path is one, and it is the path of God. And when this visible line of points is cut and not tightly arranged, the existence of the line does not appear, and the purpose is the existence of the line. This is the meaning of compact arrangement for the existence of God's path. Whoever does not have representation in the manifestation of God's path is not among the people of God. Likewise, the rows of those praying are not in the path of God until they connect and people press together in them, and at that moment God's path appears in its essence. Whoever does not do this, and introduces gaps, is among those who strive to cut off God's path and remove it from existence.

God wants from His servants, in such matters, to make them among the creators, and therefore He said: "So blessed is Allah, the best of creators."¹ And the path cannot be except thus. Like a line formed from adjacent points between which there is no empty space without a point. Only then does the form of the line appear. Likewise, the row does not manifest God's path until people press together in it, thus it requires multiplicity.

And in relation to God, it is the compact arrangement of His names—blessed and exalted is He—so from their arrangement appears² the path of creation; thus the Living is adjacent to the All-Knowing, with no gap between them for another name, and adjacent to it is the Willing, and adjacent to it is the Speaking, and adjacent to it is the Powerful, and adjacent to it is the Judge, and adjacent to it is the Sustainer, and adjacent to it is the Equitable, and adjacent to it is the Director, and adjacent to it is the Distinguisher, and adjacent to it is the Provider, and adjacent to it is the Life-Giver. Thus is the row of divine names for creating the path of creation, whose existence comes through this compact arrangement.

When this path appears, which is nothing more than the compact arrangement of these names, creation becomes characterized by these names; because through their arrangement, which is their state, the path of creation emerges, and it continues to manifest in creation, transferred only in this manner.

Thus the cosmos is: Living, Knowing, Willing, Speaking, Powerful, Judge, Sustainer, Equitable, Director, Distinguisher... and so on to the rest of the divine names, and this is what is expressed in the spiritual path as assuming the character of the divine names. They appear in the servant just as they appear in

# Creation of the Straight Path Through Compaction

Creation of the straight path through their compaction, for if there is a gap in their existence within the cosmos, then the path of God vanishes, and the path of devils appears, which infiltrate the gaps in the ranks, as reported in the tradition. So be mindful of what would destroy you in this regard.

When the servant stands with the names of the Truth, in the position of the names in creating creation, and fights with this attribute against the enemies who are like the devils that infiltrate the gaps in the ranks, then by necessity they are victorious; because there remains no gap through which the enemy can enter. Thus, God loves those who possess this attribute. Likewise, the human being alone is a rank in everything in which he is moving, so all his movements should be for God, not infiltrated by anything for other than God, thus no one can resist him. For the enemies' eyes are fixed upon him: they observe his movements and actions, hoping to find a gap through which they can enter upon him, thereby cutting off God's path between him and God.

Every line shape is a collection of divine names and praiseworthy attributes. And actions are numerous; thus the matter is unveiled and magnified, and the forms of composites appear in the world, since any two lines or more form a surface, and any two surfaces form a body, and every body is composed of eight: which is the form of perfection manifested from an essence and seven attributes.

The ultimate composition is the body and there is no rank beyond it, and it stands upon eight without disagreement among all, and what exceeds this is more corporeal, meaning more surfaces, and when it has more surfaces it has more lines, and when it has more lines it has more points. So nothing increases beyond what constitutes the body which is the first of bodies in substance except what was before the first, or that by which the first body came to be.

Whoever is disciplined in this attribute becomes a creator. The Exalted said: "Blessed is God, the Best of creators." Thus He affirmed this description for them, and made Himself the best due to His precedence in this; for were it not for Him, the entities of these creators would not have appeared.

So affirm what God has affirmed and do not remove it, lest you be deprived of the benefit of knowledge through conformity with the Truth, so that you would be among the creators, and thus among the ignorant. Whoever possesses this attribute is beloved to God the Exalted, and whoever is beloved, no one knows what his lover will give him; as He gives of Himself.

I have raised here a question that requires clarification, which is that God loves His friends (awliyāʾ), yet love does not generate its beloved. 
No one suffers more pain¹ in this world nor undergoes more trials than the friends of God: His messengers, prophets, and their protected followers,
those who are assisted against their adherents. From what reality do they deserve these trials, while being beloved? Let us say that God said:
"He loves them and they love Him"² and trials never occur except where there is a claim. One who does not claim something is not tested with providing
evidence for the truthfulness of his claim; were it not for the claim, there would be no trial. However, the Messenger is not asked for evidence,
for he has not made a claim. This is why it is said: "The one who denies is not required to provide evidence."

But this is not so; rather, evidence is required of him if he claims a negation. If he claims the negation of something, this is
the affirmation of the claim itself, so the one who denies is, in terms of his claim, required to provide evidence, because he is affirming. When God loved
those whom He loved among His servants, He bestowed His love upon them from where they knew not, and they found in themselves a love for God.
They claimed that they were among those who love God, so God tested them in their capacity as lovers, and blessed them in their capacity as beloved. His blessing is
evidence of His love for them, "And to God belongs the conclusive argument,"³ and His testing them is due to what they claimed of their love for Him. This is why
God tests His beloved among created beings. "And God speaks the truth and He guides to the way."⁴

And of⁵ that is the love of beauty:

(Beauty) is a divine attribute. It is established in the authentic tradition that the Messenger of God ﷺ said: "Indeed God is beautiful and loves
beauty." He alerted us with his saying "beautiful" to love Him. So we are divided into two groups regarding this. Among us are those who look to the beauty of
perfection, which is the beauty of wisdom, and love Him in everything, because everything is perfectly made, and it is the work of the Wise. And among us
are those who have not reached this rank, and have no knowledge of beauty except this constrained beauty, dependent on purpose. And this is
in the Law the meaning of his saying: "Worship God as though you see Him," as he used the kāf of similitude. So this person who has not reached

Understanding goes beyond this stolid beauty, so He bound him to it, as He bound him to the qibla; thus he loved Him for His beauty. And there is no fault in him for this; for he has performed what is prescribed for him according to his capacity, and "God does not burden any soul beyond its capacity."¹

Now we must address His—Exalted is He—love of beauty. Know that God created the world with perfect mastery and precision, as Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali said: "There could not be in possibility anything more perfect than this world." He informed that "God created Adam according to His image," and the human is the totality of the world. His—Exalted is He—knowledge of the world was nothing but His knowledge of Himself, as nothing existed except Him, so it must be according to His image. When He manifested it in its essence, it became His mirror, wherein He saw nothing but His beauty, so He loved beauty.

The world is God's beauty, for He is the Beautiful who loves beauty. Whoever loves the world with this perspective loves it with God's love, and loves nothing but God's beauty, for the beauty of a creation is not attributed to itself, but rather to its creator. The beauty of the world is God's beauty, and the form of His beauty is subtle, I mean the beauty of things. This is because two forms in the world, such as two individuals whom nature loves, whether two maidens or two young men, share in the reality of humanity, so they resemble each other. The perfection of the form—which is fundamental—comes from the perfection of limbs and faculties, and the soundness of the whole and individual parts from defects and flaws. One of them is described as beautiful, so everyone who sees him loves him. The other is described as ugly, so everyone who sees him dislikes him. So what is this beauty that has been named beauty, such that everyone who sees it loves it? We have left you to discern that knowledge through your own self and perception. This is when love for a person occurs from merely seeing them, not after companionship and intimacy. So reflect and observe, and you will—God willing—discover the reality of the matter regarding God's description of Himself as beautiful and His love for beauty, despite His creation of the disliked, the harmful, and what is incompatible with temperaments and contrary to desires.

We have mentioned some of the qualities that God loves in those who possess them, and they are very numerous. We have alerted you through what we have mentioned to their source and how one should employ them. Let us mention some of the characteristics of love that love ought to have—God willing—by which it is called love, for these are like the definitions of love.

# (Attributes of the Lover)

Among these are: he is characterized as slain, perishing, vigilant toward his beloved through all means, flying, perpetually sleepless, harboring hidden sorrow, desiring to exit this world to meet his beloved, bound to the companionship of what separates him from meeting his beloved, sighing abundantly, finding comfort in the words of his beloved and in mentioning him through recitation of his remembrance, conforming to the state of his beloved, fearing the abandonment of reverence in performing service, considering much from himself as little in the right of his Lord, and deeming little from his beloved as much, embracing obedience to his beloved and avoiding opposition to him.

Completely outside of himself, not seeking blood money for his slaying, patient through hardships from which natural disposition flees because his beloved has charged him with his governance, bewildered of heart, preferring his beloved over all companions, effaced in affirmation, having readied himself for whatever his beloved desires of him, interpenetrated in attributes, possessing nothing alongside him; entirely his, tiring himself by himself for the sake of his beloved, experiencing pleasure in bewilderment, transcending boundaries after preserving them, jealous for his beloved because of him, his love ruling over him according to the measure of his intellect, wounded by the Compeller, his love accepting neither increase through the beloved's kindness nor decrease through opposition to him, forgetting his portion and the portion of his beloved, not bound by etiquettes, stripped of attributes, unknown in names, as though asking yet not asking, not distinguishing between union and separation, madly infatuated in boldness, possessing confusion beyond measure.
He says of himself: he is the very essence of his beloved, overwhelmed, exhausted.

He does not say to his beloved: Why did you do this? Or why did you say this? Forbidden from concealment: his secret is public, his disgrace is perpetual, he knows not how to keep secrets, he knows not that he loves, abundant in longing yet knows not for whom, great in ecstasy yet knows not with whom, his beloved is not distinct to him, joyful, sorrowful, described by opposites, his station is grief, his state speaks for him, he loves not for compensation, intoxicated never sobering, vigilant, bewildered by what pleases his beloved, preferring in his beloved mercy toward him and compassion due to what the witness of his state gives him. Possessing varied states, whenever finished he exerts himself anew, knows not fatigue, his spirit a gift and his body a mount, knowing nothing except what is in the soul of his beloved, of tranquil eye, speaking only with His words.

They are those named the bearers of the Qur'an, for when the possessed ones gathered all attributes, they became the essence of the Qur'an, as she said

Aisha was asked about the character of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and she said: "His character was the Qur'an." She did not answer with anything else.

Dhū'l-Nūn was asked about "the bearers of the Qur'an," who are they? He said: They are those upon whom the clouds of faith have rained, who have exhausted their knees and bodies, who have clothed themselves in fear and sorrow, who have drunk from the cup of certainty, and have disciplined themselves with the discipline of those who have attained certainty: their strength lies in what is small yet sufficient, what delivers and suffices, what conceals¹ and covers. They have lined their eyes with wakefulness, lowered them from gazing, bound them to lessons, and filled them with contemplation: they stand through the night alert, and their tear ducts flow with watering. They accompany the Qur'an with emaciated bodies, withered lips, flowing tears, and speaking sighs: it has come between them and the pleasures of the indulgent, and the ultimate hopes of the desirous, so their estrangement overflows from His warning², and their forelocks have turned gray from His admonition; it is as if the exhalation of hellfire is beneath their feet, and as if His warning is fixed before their hearts."

Among the most subtle accounts we have narrated regarding the state of the lover is about "a certain person among the lovers who came to one of the shaykhs. The shaykh spoke to him about love, and that person continued to dissolve, melt, and flow with sweat, until his entire body dissolved and became a pool of water on the mat before the shaykh: he had completely melted. Then his companion entered and did not see anyone with the shaykh. So he asked him: 'Where is so-and-so?' The shaykh said: 'Here he is,' and pointed to the water, describing his condition." This is a strange dissolution and a wondrous transformation, where he continued to reduce from his density until he returned to water.

He was first alive through water      Now he gives life to everything³

For Allah said: {And We made from water every living thing}⁴. Love, according to this, is that by which everything lives.

My father—may Allah have mercy on him—or my uncle, I do not know which of them told me, informed me that he saw a hunter who had caught a turtledove, a woodland dove, with a "sāq ḥurr"⁵ which is its male. When he looked at her after the hunter had slaughtered her, he flew high in the sky, soaring until he ascended, and we were watching him until he nearly⁶ disappeared from our sight. Then he folded his wings, shrouded himself with them, and positioned his head toward the earth, and descended with a resonant fall until he landed upon her. He died instantly, while we were watching.

To Him. This is the act of a bird! O you who love; where is your claim in loving your Lord!?

Muhammad ibn Muhammad related to us from Hibat al-Rahman from Abu al-Qasim ibn Hawazin, who said: "I heard Muhammad ibn al-Husayn saying: I heard Ahmad ibn Ali saying: I heard Ibrahim ibn Fatik saying: I heard Samnun as he was sitting speaking in the mosque about love, and a small bird came near him, then drew closer. It continued approaching until it sat on his hand, then struck the ground with its beak until blood flowed from it, and it died. This is the act of the lover in the bird; God had made it understand the words of this sheikh, so the state overcame it, and the authority of love ruled over it.

* * *

An admonition for those present, and a proof against the heretics:

God has given us an abundant share of it, except that He has strengthened us for it. By God, I experience such love that if what is in my opinion were placed upon the sky, it would split apart; and upon the stars, they would darken; and upon the mountains, they would be set in motion. This is my taste of it.

But the Truth has strengthened me in it with the strength of one whom it melted, and he is the head of lovers. Indeed, I have seen within myself such wonders in it that no description of one who describes could reach. Love is according to the manifestation, and manifestation is according to knowledge. And everyone who melts in it and its effects appear upon them, that is natural love. The love of the knowers has no trace in the visible realm, for knowledge erases its traces, due to a secret it gives that none know except the knowers.

The lover who knows: alive, not dying; a pure spirit; nature has no knowledge of what love he carries; his love is divine, and his longing is lordly, supported by His name "the Holy" against the influence of sensory speech. The proof of this: he who melted until he became water, had he not possessed love, this would not have been his state; he was a lover and did not melt, until he heard the speech of the sheikh; then the hidden aspect of his love stirred, and what happened happened. The lover has no authority in love until it is stirred by the speech of a speaker—it is natural love, because nature is what accepts transformation and stirring. As he was described with love before the sheikh's speech, yet did not experience this melting that turned him to water, after having been bone, flesh, and nerve. Had the love been divine, the words of letters would not have affected him, nor would these circumstances have stirred his spirituality;

He felt ashamed of his claim in love, and the fire of shyness arose in his heart, which continued to envelop him until he became as has been related.

Change and transformation in essences, and moving through the stages of existence, affect only the possessor of natural love. This is the distinction between divine spiritual love and natural love.

Spiritual love stands between divine love and natural love. What is divine preserves its essence, while what is natural changes its state and does not preserve it. Annihilation always comes from the direction of natural love, while the preservation of essence comes from divine love. When Gabriel's love was spiritual—and he is a spirit with an aspect facing nature through his corporeality, for celestial bodies beyond the elements do not transform, unlike elemental bodies¹ which do transform because they originate from transformable principles, while nature itself does not transform since realities do not change in their essences—Gabriel fainted but the essence of his bodily substance did not disappear, unlike the one in the story who melted away. He fainted due to what was in him of natural love, while his essence remained due to his divine love.

Divine love is a spirit without a body, natural love is a body without spirit, and spiritual love possesses both body and spirit. The elemental natural lover has no spirit to preserve him from transformation; therefore, speech in Paradise affects natural love, but does not affect divine love, while having some effect on spiritual love. Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Fatā related to us in Mecca, saying: 'Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Ali told us, saying: Abu Bakr ibn Habib al-'Amiri informed us, saying: 'Ali ibn Abi Sadiq informed us, saying: Abu 'Abdullah ibn Babawayh al-Shirazi informed us, saying: Bakran ibn Ahmad informed us, saying: I heard Yusuf ibn al-Husayn say: I was sitting before Dhu'l-Nun, with people around him while he was speaking to them. The people were weeping, but a young man was laughing! Dhu'l-Nun said to him: "What is with you, young man? The people are weeping while you laugh!" He began to recite:

All of them are guided by fear of fire       And they see salvation as a great fortune
I have no concern² with Paradise or Fire       I seek no substitute for my love

It was said to him: "And if He drives you away, what will you do?" He replied:

If I cannot find connection through love,     I will cast myself to dwell and rest in pitch
Then I'll eulogize its inhabitants with my weeping     Morning and evening over my debtor
O assembly of polytheists, lament for me¹     When I loved a Majestic Master
I was not truthful in what I claimed     So He punished me with severe torment

I personally served a woman from among the gnostic notables in Seville, called Fatima bint Ibn al-Muthanna al-Qurtubi. I served her for years when she was over ninety-five years old at the time of my service to her. I used to feel shy to look at her face, despite her age, because of the redness of her cheeks, the beauty of her voice, and her overall beauty.

You would think she was a fourteen-year-old girl from her voice and her grace, and she had a special state with God.

She preferred me over all who served her from among my peers, and would say: "I have never seen anyone like him: when he enters my presence, he enters with his entirety, leaving nothing of himself outside; and when he leaves my presence, he leaves with his entirety, leaving nothing of himself with me." And I heard her say: "I am amazed at one who claims to love God yet does not rejoice in Him, while He is witnessed: His eye gazes into every eye, absent not even for the blink of an eye. So these weepers! How do they claim to love Him yet weep? Are they not ashamed? When His nearness exceeds the nearness of those who draw near to Him, and the lover has the greatest proximity to Him, He is constantly witnessed. So for whom do they weep? This is truly astonishing!" Then she would say to me: "My son, what do you say about what I say?" I would reply: "My mother, the word is your word." She said: "By God, I am astonished! My Beloved has given me the Opening of the Book [Fatiha] to serve me, and by God, it has not distracted me from Him." On that day I understood this woman's spiritual station when she said that the Opening of the Book serves her.

While we were sitting, a woman entered and said to me: "My brother, my husband is in Jerez of Shudhunh², I have been informed that he has married there; what do you advise?" I asked her: "Do you want him to return?" She said: "Yes." So I turned my face to

The old woman, and I said to her: "O mother, do you not hear what this woman is saying?" She said: "And what do you want, my son?" I said:
"To fulfill her need at this time, and my need is that her husband should come." She said: "I hear and obey; I shall direct the Opening of the Book to him,
and instruct it to bring this woman's husband." And she began reciting the Opening of the Book, and I recited it with her.
She performed her station¹ while reciting the Fatiha; and that is because she created for us through her recitation an embodied aerial form, so we remained in
that state. When she created its form, I heard her say to it: "O Opening of the Book; go² to Jerez, and bring
this woman's husband, and do not leave him³ until you bring him here." It took only the duration of the journey from his location,
and he arrived to his family.

She used to play the tambourine and rejoice. I would question her about this. She would say to me: "I rejoice in Him as He
has shown care for me, and made me one of His friends, and chosen me for Himself. Who am I that this Master should choose me over the children
of my kind?! By the honor of my Companion; He is jealous over me with a jealousy I cannot describe: whenever I turn toward anything, desiring it out of
heedlessness, He afflicts me with a trial in that very thing I turned toward." Then I abstained from that. I continued to serve her
myself, and built for her a house of reeds, with my own hands, according to her stature, and she remained in it until she passed away. And she
used to say to me: "I am your divine mother" and to "Nur" "your lordly mother." And when my mother would come to visit her, she would say to her: "O
Nur; this is my son, and he is your father! So treat him well, and do not disobey him."

Yunus ibn Yahya informed us in Mecca, in the year five hundred and ninety-nine, saying: Abu Bakr ibn al-Ghazal told us, saying:

coverings of the Kaaba, weeping, and saying in his weeping: "I was distant from You in my own land, and my journey was sent to You, and I became occupied
with You alone. I am amazed at one who knows You, how he could forget You, and one who has tasted Your love, how he could bear to be apart from You!" Then he began [reciting]

Then he said: My dear one; why is it that when I stand before You, drowsiness confuses me, and You prevent me from the sweetness of intimate discourse with You? Why, O coolness of my eye, why? Then he began to recite:

Nothing more bitter than separation and more painful

# Story of a lover who disclosed the secret of his beloved:

Muhammad ibn Ismā'īl ibn Abī al-Ḍayf informed us, 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn 'Alī told us, al-Hamdānī ibn Nāṣir and Ibn 'Abd al-Bāqī reported to us, and Yūnus ibn Yaḥyā also told me on their authority, they said: Ḥamd ibn Aḥmad reported to us, Aḥmad ibn 'Abdullāh reported to us, Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Mutawakkilī told us, Aḥmad ibn 'Alī ibn Thābit told us, 'Alī ibn al-Qāsim al-Shāhid reported to us, saying: I heard Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn 'Īsā al-Rāzī say: I heard Yūsuf ibn al-Ḥusayn say: There was a young man who attended the gatherings of Dhū al-Nūn al-Miṣrī for a period, then he was absent for a time, then he appeared before him with a yellowed complexion, emaciated body, and showing signs of devotion and striving. Dhū al-Nūn said to him: O young man, what rewards has service to your Master and your striving earned you from the gifts that God has granted you, bestowed upon you, and distinguished you with? The young man said: O master, have you ever seen a servant whom his master has selected from among his slaves, chosen him, and given him the keys to the treasuries, then confided a secret to him—would it be appropriate for him to disclose that secret? Then he began to recite:

Whoever is entrusted with a secret and then strives to disclose it     
Will never be trusted with secrets as long as he lives
They will become his enemies, their souls will not be pleased with him     
And they will replace his companionship with estrangement

He says: Exertion is not valid in the secret of love; rather, one must await the command of the beloved. If the beloved commands its disclosure, one discloses it, and if not, then the principle is concealment.

God granted me one of His secrets in the city of Fez, in the year five hundred and ninety-four [1197-8 CE], and I disclosed it. For I did not know that it was among the secrets that should not be disclosed. I was called to account for this by the Beloved! I had no response except silence. But I said to Him: "Take charge Yourself of this matter with those whom I entrusted with it, if You are jealous over it, for You have the power and I do not." I had entrusted it to about eighteen men. He said to me: "I will take charge of this." Then He informed me that He had removed it from their hearts and taken it back from them, while I was in Ceuta. I said to my companion Abdullah al-Khadim: "God has informed me that He has done such and such, so let us travel to the city of Fez to see what He mentioned to me about this."

So I traveled, and when that group came to me, I found that God had indeed stripped them of it and extracted it from their hearts. They asked me about it, and I remained silent. This is among the most wondrous things that happened to me in this regard. Praise be to God that He did not punish me with the estrangement that Dhū'l-Nūn mentioned.

Since the path of God is experiential, this young man imagined that the way the Real dealt with him is how He deals with all creation². His personal experience is valid, but his judgment about God in this matter is not valid. This happens frequently except among the verifiers (muḥaqqiqūn), for such things do not happen to them due to their knowledge of the ranks of matters and their realities, which is a knowledge difficult to attain.

We have received from Dhū'l-Nūn, in a narration by Muhammad ibn Yazid from Dhū'l-Nūn, who said: I asked a woman, "When are worries removed from the lover's heart?" She replied, "When he is a neighbor to remembrance and present with longing. O Dhū'l-Nūn, don't you know that longing brings about illness, and renewing remembrance brings about sorrow." Then she said:

I did not taste the sweetness of union with you until      My love for all people departed from me

He said: So I answered her:

Yes, the lover when his union increases,    
And his love is known by the heart of union.

She said: "You have hurt me, you have hurt me! Don't you know that one cannot reach Him except by abandoning all that is beneath Him?"

I said¹: If she had said to me something like this, I would have told her: "If there is anything else there."

More than one person has told us, among them Ibn Abi al-Sayf from Abd al-Rahman ibn Ali, who said: I heard from Ibrahim ibn Dinar, who said: Isma'il ibn Muhammad told me, Abd al-Aziz ibn Ahmad informed me, Abu al-Shaykh Abdullah ibn Muhammad told me, saying: I heard Abu Sa'id al-Thaqafi relating from Dhu'l-Nun who said: I was performing the circumambulation [of the Ka'ba] when I heard a sorrowful voice², and there was a young woman clinging to the curtains of the Ka'ba, saying:

You know, O my beloved        O my beloved, you know
And the emaciation of my body and soul reveals my secret
O my dear one, I have concealed love until my breast became constricted

Dhu'l-Nun said: What I heard moved me deeply, until I sobbed and wept. And she said: "My God, my Master, my Lord; by Your love for me, forgive me." He said: This affected me, and I said: "O young woman, is it not enough for you to say 'my love for You,' that you must say 'Your love for me'?" She replied: "Away with you, O Dhu'l-Nun! Don't you know that Allah loves certain people before they love Him? Have you not heard Allah saying: 'Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him'³? His love for them preceded their love for Him." I asked: "How did you know I am Dhu'l-Nun?" She said: "O idle one! Hearts have roamed in the arena of secrets, and thus I recognized you." Then she said: "Look behind you." I turned around, and she was gone; I do not know whether the sky snatched her up or the earth swallowed her!!

I say: The story of this young woman resembles the state of Moses, peace be upon him, with his Lord: "Look at the mountain"⁴.

Allah the Exalted has arenas called: all the arenas of love, and then each arena is distinguished by a name from the attributes of love, such as: the arena of ecstasy, and the arena of longing. And every state in which there is movement and roaming has its arena.

# This is a universal matter. Likewise, for the knowledges there are presences and assemblies, which are not arenas, except when He—glory be to Him¹—makes you witness in His knowledge His differentiation in the entities of existents. If you witness that He is the Eye that appears in them through His names, then those are the arenas of secrets. And if you witness His withness with existents through His names, then those are the arenas of lights. And if the matter becomes confused for you, so that you see a thing and say: "He is He," then you see a thing and say: "He is not He," then you see a thing and say: "I do not know whether He is He, or He is not He," those are the arenas of bewilderment. For each entity of existence there is a sign known to whoever roams in these arenas; through that sign he recognizes who possesses it in the world of witnessing, in these naturally darkened frames, illuminated through knowledge. From there he discerns them by their names, like the state of this female servant.

We have related from the hadith of Musa ibn Ali al-Ikhmimi, from Dhul-Nun, that he met a man in Yemen whom he had traveled to see, in a long account which includes: "Then Dhul-Nun said to him: May God have mercy on you! What is the sign of one who loves God? He replied: My beloved, the degree of love is an elevated degree. He said: I would like you to describe it to me. He said: The lovers of God, their hearts have been opened, so they behold with the light of their hearts the might of God's majesty. Their bodies have become worldly, their spirits loving, and their intellects heavenly, roaming among the ranks of angels, witnessing those matters with certainty. They worship Him with all their capability out of love for Him, not out of desire for paradise, nor fear of hellfire." So this youth had a doubt within himself.

We say: This speaker was among the knowers. For he mentioned what indicates this, which are three forms—there is nothing in existence but them. He said:

Their bodies are worldly, because "And in the earth is a deity."² Therefore, some of his realities³ must be left for whoever is with Him in this world, since the human being encompasses the world, and this is none other than his body, because "We are closer to him than his jugular vein,"⁴ which is a bodily vein; if he were to proceed with his entirety, his state would be deficient.

# Part One Hundred Fifteen¹

## In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful²

A section with which we conclude this chapter, called among us: The Self-Disclosure of the Truth to the Loving Knowers on the Platforms of Wedding Celebrations to Bestow the Qualities of Lovers in Love. Among these:

**A Platform and Self-Disclosure: The Lover is characterized as slain, because he is composed of nature and spirit:**

The spirit is light and nature is darkness      and both within his essence are opposites³

The two opposites are mutually repellent, and those that repel each other are in conflict. Each one seeks rulership for itself, and that sovereignty should return to it.

The lover cannot avoid either being dominated by nature, in which case his form is darkened, and he loves the Truth in creation, thus folding light into darkness, relying on the fundamental principle in His saying: {And a sign for them is the night, from which We strip away the day, and behold, they are in darkness}⁴. Thus he knows that they are adjacent even if they are opposites, and that one of them can be enfolded within the other, so it does not harm me to love the Truth in creation in order to unite the two matters.

Or he may be dominated by spirit, in which case his form is illuminated; so he loves creation in the Truth according to His saying: "Love God for what He benefits you with through His blessings." So I loved Him in the blessings according to His command. Thus his witnessing is of the Truth. And through both of these jealousy occurs between the opposites, and each opposite sees that its object of desire might free itself for its opposite. It says: I will kill it so that my opposite does not manifest through it instead of me. If nature kills him, he dies while being a lover of created beings, and if the spirit kills him, he becomes a martyr, alive with his Lord, receiving provision. So he is slain in any case, every lover in the world, even if he is not aware of it.

**A Platform and Self-Disclosure: The Lover is characterized as creator:**

This is because God created him from His two names, the Manifest and the Hidden, making him a world of the unseen and the witnessed. And He created for him an intellect

He distinguishes between the rule of the two names to establish the balance between the two worlds in His essence, then He manifested to him in His name: "There is nothing like unto Him"¹ other than Him. This manifestation did not grant him the establishment of balance, especially when He said to him: "And He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"¹. So he became annihilated insofar as he did not see a state requiring justice and the establishment of balance; he departed from the boundary of obligation, as only a rational person supported by his intellect is obligated. This is the attribute of love, that it is annihilating.

* * *

A Platform and Manifestation: We describe it as journeying to Him through His names:

This is because He manifested to him in the names of existence, and manifested to him in His Beautiful Names. So he imagines in His manifestation through the names of existence that it:

Returns from the Real in his regard      Though this was not from his horizon²

When he adorned himself with His Beautiful Names, he was overcome by what became the way of the People of God in assuming divine qualities. He imagined that the names of existence were created³ for him, not for God, and that the Real's status in them⁴ is like the servant's status in His Beautiful Names. So he said: I will not enter into His presence except through my names, and when I go out to His creation, I go out to them with His Beautiful Names, as an assumption of divine qualities.

When he entered into His presence with what he thought were his names—which to him were the names of existence—he saw what the prophets saw of signs in their night journeys and ascensions in the horizons and within themselves. Then he realized that all are His names—Exalted is He—and that the servant has no name of his own, such that even the name "servant" is not his own, but rather relates to Him like the rest of the Beautiful Names. So he knew that the journey to Him, entering into His presence, and being present with Him is only through His names, and that the names of existence are His names. This realization corrected his error after what had been neglected was neglected. This witnessing compensated for what he had missed when he distinguished between the worshipper and the worshipped.

This is a precious manifestation on a magnificent platform that was the aim of Abu Yazid al-Bistami, though he fell short of it. For his utmost was what he said about himself: "You drew near to me through what is not mine." This was his portion from his Lord beyond his ultimate goal. And so it is; for it is his ultimate goal, not the Ultimate Goal.

# Another Method

This is another method I have not seen in the experiential states of any of the saints except specifically the prophets and messengers. From this divine manifestation, they describe Him—glory be to Him—with what is called in formal theology "attributes of similitude"; they imagine that the Truth has described Himself with attributes of creation, and so they interpret this allegorically. But this witnessing reveals that every name belonging to the cosmos originates in truth from the Truth, and for creation it is merely a verbal expression without meaning, though it¹ is related to Him. Understand this.

## Platform and Manifestation: (The Lover's Breath in God is Soaring)

The lover's breath in God is soaring,    a sound knowledge with no dust upon it

This verse is not intended: it is what we mentioned regarding the names of the cosmos. It was imagined that these names were his burden, but when it became clear to him that he was unburdened, he appeared; he soared beyond his existence and his remembrance, and flew in the atmosphere of his existence² as names of his Truth. Thus in every breath he flies from one breath to another, because the essence of all names belongs to the One who "each day is engaged in a matter." There is no day except that the lover flies in it from one matter to another. This is what his witnessing reveals.

* * *

## Platform and Manifestation: The Lover's Breath in God is Perpetually Awake:

When he saw that the Beloved "neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him,"³ he knew that this comes from His station of love for preserving the world. What called him to this perspective is that the Truth transforms into various forms, and forms have effects, and among the effects of some forms is sleep. Yet he saw Him in such a form where "neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him" from the perspective of this form, so he knew that this comes from His station of love for preserving the world. Since the lover is the companion of his beloved, and his beloved has this attribute, sleep is forbidden to him. The lover says during separation: "Sleep is forbidden to me," so how would it be during witnessing and companionship? One of them said regarding the wakefulness of separation:

Sleep for me is forbidden,    How can one who is separated from loved ones sleep!

So sleep during direct witnessing is even more remote and distant.

# Platform and Station: The Description of the Lover as One Who Conceals Grief:

That is, his grief is veiled with no outward manifestation. The cause of this is Allah's saying (Exalted is He): "They did not esteem Allah as He should be esteemed." Then, in his witnessing, he sees that not an atom moves except by His permission, since He is the mover of it in whatever movement it undertakes. And he sees in his witnessing how creation confronts its Creator with improper conduct, and with what should not be attributed to that whose essence is non-existence. He wishes to speak and reveal what is in his soul of the jealousy that protective zeal demands, but then he sees that this too is by His permission, for he is among those who see Allah before all things—the station of Abu Bakr—so he becomes still. It is not possible for him to display his grief, because the lover is governed by the understanding that such treatment of the Beloved is unfitting, even as he sees that He has given His creation power over Him through their oppression, though they have no excuse; and He has sent the veil between them. So this lover conceals his grief in this world, for in the Hereafter he will have no grief, and for this reason he seeks to depart from this world.

***

# Platform and Station: The Description of the Lover as One Who Desires to Leave This World to Meet His Beloved:

This is for the reason we mentioned in the previous section. For the soul by its nature seeks rest, and grief is toil, being toil, and this world is the abode of griefs. What is specific to this platform is his desire to meet his Beloved, which is a specific meeting designated by the Real, as He is witnessed in every state.

But since He has designated whatever He willed of the spiritual realms and made them places for specific encounters, we desire this, and we cannot attain it except by leaving the abode that negates this meeting, which is the worldly abode. The Prophet ﷺ was given the choice between remaining in this world and transferring to the next, and he said: "The Highest Companion," for in the state of this world one is in the company of the lower. And it is reported in the hadith that "whoever loves to meet Allah"—meaning through death—"Allah loves to meet him, and whoever detests meeting Allah, Allah detests meeting him." So let him meet Him in death with what He detests, which is being veiled from Him, whereas He manifests to those among His servants who love to meet Him.

Meeting the Real through death has a taste unlike meeting Him in the worldly life. Thus, the relation of our meeting Him through death is the relation

His saying: ﴿We shall attend to you, O you two classes [of jinn and mankind]﴾¹ And death for us is the release of our spirits from managing our bodies. Thus they desired, even this lover, to attain this experientially. And this cannot occur except by departing from the abode of this world, through death not wealth; which is that he separates from this structure with which he has developed familiarity, from the time he was born and appeared through it, rather it was the cause of his manifestation. Thus the Real distinguished between him and this body due to the established connection between them.

This is from the state of divine jealousy over His servants, due to His love for them. He does not want there to be any connection between them and other than Him; so He created death and tested them with it, as a purification of their claims of loving Him. When His decree is fulfilled², Yahya (peace be upon him) will slaughter it [death] between Paradise and Hellfire, so none of the inhabitants of the two abodes will die. This is the reason for their desire to leave this world to meet the Beloved, because the interval is exhaustion. And death will be brought to life through slaughter, a specific life, just as we are judged after death, for "people are asleep and when they die, they awaken."

A Flash and Manifestation: The attribute of the lover is that he is weary of accompanying whatever prevents him from meeting his beloved:

This attribute is more complete in love than the first. For the knower has nothing between him and meeting his beloved except non-existence, which is not there, as existence is none other than Him; he witnesses Him in every eye that sees. There is nothing between the lover and the beloved except the veil of creation, so he knows that there is a creator and created, but he cannot remove the companionship of this reality, for it is his very essence. A thing cannot remove itself from itself, and his self stands between him and meeting his beloved. So he is weary of himself due to being created, and his companionship with himself is essential and can never be removed; thus he remains perpetually weary.

This is why he is weary; because he imagines that if he leaves this structure, he leaves composition, returning to simplicity with no second, becoming singular in his oneness, which he multiplies by the oneness of the Real; and this is the meeting. Thus the Real becomes (He) the product after multiplication, not him. This is what makes him weary. The knower who loves is not weary of this because of his knowledge of the matter as it truly is, as we mentioned in the treatise "On Union."

# Alerting and Summarizing: The Lover's Investigation with the Perfect Expert:

This is His saying: "Indeed, Abraham was compassionate and forbearing."[2] The Real described Himself, from the perspective of His name "the All-Merciful," as having a breath through which He relieves His servants, and in that breath the cosmos appeared. This is why He made the creation of the cosmos through the command: "Be!"

The letter is the interruption of air, for the air generates what it itself is. This is because the letter appears only when the air is interrupted, and air is breath. For this reason, air among the elements is the breath of Nature, and thus it receives letters, which are what appears in it as sounds during blowing.

What manifests from these sounds are the letters hā' and hamza, and they are the furthest of the articulation points, the points of articulation of letters. They are nearest to the heart, and they are the first of the throat letters, rather the chest letters. They are the first letter formed by one who breathes, and that is the sighing (ta'awwuh) due to its proximity to the heart, which is the locus of the breath's exit and emission. From it all letters appear, just as the cosmos appears through creation from the command: "Be!" This is a wondrous secret that I will mention in the chapter on breath (nafas - with the fatha on the fā') - God willing.

When the Real manifests from the heart of the lover, and the eye of insight beholds Him - because "the heart encompasses the Real" - and he sees the blame placed upon this natural constitution, which contains these divine secrets, and that it appeared in existence from the breath of the All-Merciful, its value is advanced and revealed. Thus, his sighing increases because of this opening, due to what he sees in it of clarity and manifestation, while people remain blind to it, not perceiving. So he sighs partly out of jealousy for God and compassion for the veiled, since the Prophet ﷺ made the perfection of faith in the believer "that he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Therefore, he regrets for those whom God has deprived of this witnessing, and he partly sighs from his love for his Beloved, because of what he sees of the manifestation of creation from Him. It is the nature of the lover to have compassion for the beloved, because love bestows that.

And the meaning of "mentioning": the lover's investigation that he is listening to the speech of his beloved, and mentioning him through the recitation of his remembrance:

God - the Exalted - said: "Indeed, We have sent down the Remembrance."¹ So He named His speech as remembrance. Know that the origin of the existence of the cosmos was not from any divine attribute except specifically from the attribute of Speech; for nothing is known of the cosmos except His speech. And it is what was heard, so there is confidence in its hearing, and it could not but exist. For this reason, hearing carries the implication of movement, disturbance, and heaviness in the hearers. Because when the hearer heard the saying: "Be," he shifted and moved from the state of non-existence to the state of existence; so he comes to be.

From here comes the origin of the movement of the people of spiritual audition (samāʿ), and they are the people of ecstasy (wajd). It is not necessary for the one who "was" (kāna), for ecstasy by its nature necessitates what it necessitates, though the beloved may differ. Love, ecstasy, longing, and all qualities of love are descriptions of the lover, regardless of who the beloved may be, except that I have specified in this book the love related to God, who is the Beloved in truth, even if He is not perceived as such in certain situations by some people, while perceived by others - and they are the knowers (ʿārifūn). They love none but God, even though they love their spirits, their families, and their companions, so know that.

To the extent that one of the righteous, as was related to us, said that Qays the Madman (Majnūn) was among those who loved God, and he made his love for Layla, and he was among the devoted ones. I took the truth of this statement from his story in which he said to Layla: "Away from me; for your love has occupied me from you," and he neither approached her nor drew near to her. It is the nature of the lover to seek through love connection with the beloved, but this action contradicts love. It is also the nature of the lover to faint upon meeting or experiencing the arrival of the beloved and to be bewildered, but this one says to her: "Away from me," without bewilderment or annihilation. So by this action, I verified the truth of what this knower said regarding Qays the Madman, and it is not far-fetched. For God has special ones among His servants.

From there, lovers find rest in the speech of the Beloved and His remembrance, and the Quran is His speech and it is remembrance, so they do not prefer

We desired upon its recitation, for they repent in it from it, so it is as if it is the Speaker, as He said: "Grant him protection so that he may hear the word of Allah"¹. The reciter is only Muhammad ﷺ, thus "the people of the Qur'an are the people of Allah and His elect," and they are the chosen beloved ones.

A Quality and a Hastened [Matter]: The Description of the Lover as Being in Accordance with the Nature of His Beloved:

This can only be among the qualities of those who love Allah specifically, due to His exaltedness - He cannot be limited nor bound... He is the one who manifests in the Name "the Near"², just as He manifests in the Name "the Distant"³, for He is the Distant-Near. The lover said:

And all that the Beloved does is beloved

So when He enacts distance, the beloved [thing] to him becomes distance from the Beloved, because it is the beloved of the Beloved. For he loves Him with the love of the Beloved, not with his own self. And he does not love Him with the love of the Beloved except through his self; until the Beloved becomes his attribute, and when the Beloved becomes one of the lover's attributes, it subsists within him. And when it subsists within him, he is at the utmost connection in the very essence of distance, more connected than in nearness; because in nearness he exists by the attribute of himself, not by the attribute of his Beloved; for two causes cannot establish in one locus for a single effect - this is not valid. So he does not love nearness except for himself, just as he does not love distance except through his Beloved. Thus, in loving distance he is more complete in love than in loving nearness. And I have composed on this meaning:

A passion between loveliness and beauty        That the strong among men endure
While the weak of heart falters before it        Fluctuating in bliss and in coquetry
And my heart in separation, to me,        Is sweeter than embraces in union
For in union I am a mere slave to myself        But in separation, I am a servant to my Lord
And my occupation with the Beloved in every aspect        Is dearer to me than occupation with my state

In this poem is the preference for what the Beloved prefers, and it contains what we have indicated in our discourse before it. As for our saying: "The Beloved is the attribute of the lover" in what we have mentioned, it is His saying, Exalted is He: "When I love him, I become his hearing and his sight." Thus He makes

===== page_82 =====



He [God] is the hearing of the servant and his sight, thus it is established that He is his essence. Love only loved the servant through his Beloved, and this is the ultimate union within the very essence of separation.

**Question and Reasoning: The lover's realization that he fears breaching reverence in performing service:**

This is because none fears this except a gnostic of intermediate level who has not reached¹ complete realization in knowledge, yet he is aware of it without tasting it, save for the taste of awareness itself. He is a lover, and the lover obeys his beloved in all his commands. The verification of the matter reveals that the commander is the essence of the commanded, and the lover is the essence of the beloved. However, the manifest appears according to what the reality of the manifestation requires, and the manifestations reveal diversities in the manifest, whereupon judgments and names differ, and through them the obedient and the disobedient appear.

Thus, one who stands at the station of awareness but has not reached the point of placing things² in their proper places in the manifest realm, fears that he might issue forth something contradicting reverence in his service, as he says: "There is none but Him." This is similar to the position of one who sees all entities as a single entity, yet does not understand how. He continues to display improper conduct because he has acquired this [knowledge] without [true] tasting. This is the doctrine of those who believe that the director of human bodies is a single spirit, and that the spirit of Zayd is identical to the spirit of Amr. This contains errors that we have mentioned elsewhere: namely, that it would necessitate that what Zayd knows, Amr cannot be ignorant of, because the knower in each one (is) his spirit's essence, which is one, and the singular thing cannot be both knowledgeable of something and ignorant of it.

So the lover fears that if he commits a lapse of reverence through a slip or error, he might afterward attribute it to what we have mentioned, thus becoming unconcerned with what manifests from him in this regard. Yet the evidence insists on nothing less than reverence for the beloved, even if the lover is pampered and loved by him, due to the lover's predominance over him, and because he sees himself as the essence of his beloved, saying: "I am the one I love and the one I love is me." This is the cause of his fear, nothing else.

# Point and Question: The Lover's Character is to Consider Much from Himself as Little in Relation to His Lord, and Little from His Beloved as Much:

This is because he distinguishes between being a lover through what he sees in himself of brokenness, humility, bewilderment, and perplexity, which are the effects of love on lovers, and he sees the pride of the beloved, his grandeur, his authority, and his claims upon him. He sees that if he were to give all that he possesses, it would be little compared to what he has given of himself, and that the right of his beloved is greater to him than his own right. Indeed, he sees no right for himself, even though in reality he strives only for his own benefit. This is what love dictates.

A certain king had a servant¹ who loved him named Iyas. Some of the king's companions entered and saw the servant's feet in the king's lap, with the king massaging them. He was astonished. Iyas said: "O you! These are not the feet of Iyas; these are the heart of the king in his lap, which he is massaging." This is the meaning of our saying: "The lover strives for his own benefit," for he experiences in that act a great pleasure that he can only attain through that act. The beloved is doing a favor when he allows the lover to experience pleasure from the beloved. The lover sees anything that comes from the beloved as abundant. It is the bestowal of a master upon a slave, while anything from the lover toward the beloved, even if it were the loss of his soul and life for his pleasure, would be considered little, for it is the obedience of a servant to a beneficent master.

"They did not esteem Allah with the esteem due to Him"². The beloved is rich, so his little is much. The lover is poor, so his much is little.

However, although this is the attribute of the lover according to them, it is the attribute of a lover whose knowledge is deficient, though his love is at its peak.

Because the lover—when he is the created being—possesses nothing that he truly owns, so as to consider it little or much.

But when the lover is Allah, He considers the little from His servant as much, as in His saying: "Fear Allah as much as you are able"⁴ and "Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity"⁵. As for His considering much as little in relation to His beloved servants, what is with Allah has no limit, and the entry of what has no limit into existence is impossible. And everything that enters into

Existence is finite. When¹ what is finite is compared to what is infinite, it appears as if it were little, or as if it were nothing, even if it were great. Here there is a perspective that would take long [to elaborate], so we shall be brief.

* * *

A Flash and Manifestation: The attribute of the Lover is that he obeys his Beloved and avoids opposing him. Their poet² said:
You disobey God while showing love for Him       This is an absurd and strange contradiction
If your love were sincere you would obey Him     For the lover is obedient to the one he loves

The lover is a servant. And the servant is one who stops at the commands of his master, and avoids contradicting his commands and prohibitions: he is not seen where [his master] has forbidden him to be, and he is not absent where [his master] has ordered him to be, always standing before him. When [the master] commands him, this lover sees that his master has bestowed favor upon him by employing him and commanding him, and that this is out of his care for him. And if he loses sight of him and his presence in what he has occupied him with, he remains in blessing and delight, by virtue of carrying out the ordinances of his master and by his permission.

If the Lover is God, then the command of His Beloved is His supplication and His desire for what is dear to him and what he loves. Then, he [the servant] dislikes certain things, so he supplicates Him with the attribute of prohibition, such as his saying: "Do not cause our hearts to deviate"³ "Do not lay upon us a burden"⁴ "Do not burden us with what we have no strength to bear"⁴. This is a request in the form of prohibition. Thus, commands and prohibitions have come from him to his master, and the Truth's response to this servant, insofar as He is a lover of this servant, is like the obedience of the servant to the commands of his master and his avoidance of contradicting him.

* * *

A Flash and Manifestation: The attribute of the Lover is that he is completely outside of himself:

Know that the self of a person, by which he is distinguished from many creatures, is his will. When he abandons his will to what his beloved wills for him, he has completely exited from himself, having no control. When his beloved wills something for him, and this lover knows what his beloved wants from him or for him, he hastens or prepares to accept it, and sees that that distinction

³ [Al 'Imran: 8]
⁴ [Al-Baqarah: 286]
⁵ p. 27b

43

===== page_85 =====


The hastening stems from the sovereignty of love which has taken control of him. The beloved sees in his lover no one who contests him in what he desires of him or from him; because the lover has completely given up himself for the beloved; thus he has no will alongside him. Yet this occurs while maintaining his own self and seeking connection with the beloved.

If this were not the case, then he would be at the level of inanimate matter which has no will. Therefore, the lover has no pleasure except the pleasure connected to the delight of his beloved, in what the beloved observes from the lover's acceptance.

The lover of God: God revealed to Moses: "O son of Adam: I created all things for your sake"—meaning this world and the next—because he is the intended essence. And he is the chief of prophets, Muhammad ﷺ. Thus everything is subjugated to this human configuration: the celestial spheres and what they contain, the stars and their movements. This is in this world. As for the Hereafter: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has it occurred to any human heart," until the ultimate matter; which is the divine manifestation on the day of the supreme visitation. This is the meaning of the lover's complete departure from himself in everything the beloved might need. As for that which the beloved has no need for, and which brings no pleasure or joy to the beloved, this does not fall under this category.

* * *

A Notification and Illustration: The lover's pursuit does not seek compensation for his action:

For we have described him initially as slain. Love's slaying is martyrdom, so its victim is alive, and for the living there is no blood-money. Blood-money is only paid for the slain who dies: for him blood-money is legislated.

The lover of God: When the servant is beloved, his will is effective. The lover has no will that contests His will. The slain has no will; and whoever exists by the will of his beloved has no will, even if he has desires. And there is no blood-money for him; because for the living there is no blood-money. And the life established for him is the love of obligatory duties, when God loves him.

In supererogatory acts (the Truth) becomes "the hearing and sight of the servant," and in obligatory acts the servant becomes "the hearing and sight of the Truth." And for this the world is established; for God does not look at the world except through the sight of this servant; so the world does not perish

Due to the relatedness. If the Real were to look at the cosmos with His sight, the cosmos would be consumed by the glories of His Face. So the Real looks at the cosmos through the sight of the Perfect Human created upon the image; this is the very veil that exists between the cosmos and the consuming glories.

* * *

A platform and station: The lover is described as one who endures harm from which natural disposition flees, due to what his Beloved has charged him with managing:

The human being is a combination of natural disposition and light. Natural disposition seeks him, and light seeks him. The light is charged to tend to and leave much of what is appropriate for it and what its reality demands, for the sake of what natural disposition seeks in terms of benefits. The light, which is the spirit, is commanded to fulfill natural disposition's right, as in his saying ﴾peace be upon him﴿ to one who asked him, "Who deserves my good treatment most?" He said, "Your mother," three times, then said to him the fourth time, "Then your father." Thus he gave precedence to the mother's hand over the father's hand. Nature is the mother, and this is his saying ﴾peace be upon him﴿: "Your self has a right over you"—that is, the animal soul—"and your eyes have a right over you." All this pertains to the rights of the mother, which is the human being's nature. His father is the divine spirit, which is the light.

When he abandons many matters of his love from the perspective of his luminosity, he is characterized as being harmed, and he is commanded to be patient. This is the meaning of "endures harm" even though his reality recoils from that, but God's command is obligatory. Then He said to him regarding his patience: ﴾Be patient, and your patience is only through God﴿¹. For God has named Himself "the Patient," as if saying to him: "I, despite the might of My majesty, have described Myself as being harmed, as forbearing and patient, and I am named the Patient, though I am neither commanded nor restricted. I have placed Myself under the veil of My creation, and I have left what is befitting for Me for what is befitting for My creation, preferring them and out of mercy toward them. So you are more deserving to endure harm through Me, that is, because of My command, and because I am² patient with the harm done by My creation, when they describe Me in ways that My majesty does not require." This is from the aspect of God being a lover in this regard³.

This is only so because his Beloved, the Real, has charged him with managing his natural constitution. So when the Beloved is (He)

## Creation and Love is the Truth

Creation, and Love is (He) the Truth, so the form of obligation is what the servant asks from his Lord, when he knows that he is beloved to his Lord, concerning the management of his affairs, on the condition of conformity with His purposes and what He loves. So the Truth does this for him. This is that meaning by which the lover is characterized.

And the lover is described and represented: The lover is described as one whose heart wanders:
Since the heart was named as such due to its numerous fluctuations and transformations; its aspects and orientations are many. This is the attribute of one who wanders, especially when the Truth manifests to him in every aspect he turns toward, and in every direction he moves¹: for he sees the essence of his Beloved in every aspect.

The lover of God: "Every day He is upon some matter"² "I do not hesitate in anything I am about to do." The multiplicity of aspects in a single matter leads to hesitation: which of them to do, while all of them please the Beloved.

We do not know what is most pleasing, but He knows what is most pleasing for us, except that we know the difference between supererogatory acts and obligatory duties, so we say: The obligatory duties are more pleasing. But when they come together under the rule of choice³: like in expiations where there is choice, the most pleasing is not known except through specific instruction.

Similarly, the most pleasing among supererogatory acts is not known except through divine guidance, and supererogatory acts are many, and each of them is pleasing in one aspect, and more pleasing in another aspect; so new instruction is necessary. In such cases, the lover's heart wanders, meaning he is perplexed⁴ among the aspects in which he wishes to turn.

And the lover is described and represented: The lover is described as one who prefers his beloved over every companion:
Since the entire world, every part of it, is a trust for the human being, and he has been charged with fulfilling the trust; and his trusts are many,

For its performance there are specific times; in each time He has an entrustment. Among these is what Abu Talib (al-Makki) called attention to: that the celestial sphere moves with the breaths of the human being—indeed, with the breath of every breathing entity.

The human being is specifically mentioned because by his movement the celestial sphere¹ moves and follows him wherever he may be. Thus, the cosmos continuously accompanies the human being for this reason.

Then, the human being is in need of these entrustments that are with the cosmos. Despite his need for them, the lovers among the knowers, the people of God, have occupied themselves with what their Beloved has commanded them. They gaze upon Him with love and rapture: His love has enslaved them, and His distance and nearness have bewildered them.

It is from here that they have declared that they prefer Him over all companions, for He is their companion, as He says: "And He is with you wherever you are"². Everyone in the cosmos also accompanies Him for the sake of the entrustment that is in their possession. Thus, the human being prefers his Beloved, for God.

Sahl (al-Tustari) was asked: "What is sustenance?" He replied: "God." They asked him: "What do you mean by that?" He said: "That by which life subsists"³ He said: "God." He saw nothing but God. When they insisted and said to him: "We are only asking about what maintains this body." When he saw that they did not understand him, he turned to another answer and said: "Leave the abode to its builder: if He wishes to build it, and if He wishes to ruin it."⁴ He means: The concern of the human subtlety is not the health of this particular structure, nor its body, so it occupies itself with what its Beloved—who is the very essence of its life and existence—has charged it with, and whatever house He settles it in, it inhabits. This is if he denies disembodiment from the natural form, as we say and as unveiling has revealed.

And if he affirms disembodiment from nature and the severance of attachment, he is in any case one who prefers God over every companion.

The Third Investigation: (God) preferred the human being, by virtue of his being His beloved, over the entire cosmos; He gave him the perfect form, which He did not give to any other category of the cosmos, even though (this cosmos) is characterized by obedience and glorification to God. Thus, He preferred him (that is, the human being) over every companion. The Exalted said: "And when your Lord said to the angels: 'Indeed, I am placing

# on earth a vicegerent¹⟩ and gave him all the Names, the divine ones; so he glorified Him with every divine name that has connection to existence, and he exalted and magnified Him; not the name of the large bowl (qaṣʿah) and the small bowl (quṣayʿah) which is claimed by those who have no knowledge of the nobility of matters.

Therefore, the angels said: ⟨We glorify You with praise and sanctify You²⟩. And none sanctifies or glorifies except through His names, so He informed them that Allah has names in the universe with which the angels had not glorified or sanctified Him, and which He had taught³ to Adam. When He brought forth what He brought forth from His creation, of which the angels had no knowledge, ⟨He said: Tell Me the names of these⟩⁴ with which you glorify and sanctify Me. They said: ⟨We have no knowledge⟩. Then He said to Adam: ⟨Inform them of their names. And when he had informed them of their names⟩⁵, they knew that Allah has names of which they had no knowledge, through which these beings whom He created glorify Him, and which Adam knew and thereby glorified Allah. As He said to the angels when they circumambulated the House with him: "What were you saying?" The angels said: "In our circumambulation before you, we used to say: 'Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is Greater.'" Adam said to them: "And I add for you: 'There is no power and no strength except through Allah,' which Allah gave to him from a treasure beneath the Throne, which the angels did not know."

If the interpreter meant by his saying "even the large bowl and the small bowl": the divine name directed toward the small and the large, so that the small glorifies Him in its smallness in a way that the large does not glorify Him in its largeness, he would be correct. But he only meant "the words qaṣʿah and quṣayʿah," and there is no nobility in such a thing, for it relates to what is agreed upon by convention; since it has in every language a name composed of letters that does not resemble the other name. What is intended is only that by which benefit is obtained, comparable to the statement of the angels in their pride over humanity: that they were glorifiers and sanctifiers. So Allah—exalted is He—showed them the nobility of Adam from the perspective of their claim, which is what we have mentioned and nothing else. There is nothing among created beings more noble than the angel, and yet⁶ the perfect human has been made superior to him through the knowledge of the Names. So he, in this presence and this station, is more excellent. This, then, is the extent of the Truth's preference for him.

# Attribute and Manifestation: Description of the Lover as Being Effacement in Affirmation:

As for his affirmation, it appears in his being charged with duties, and among the active forms of worship in his prayer, which He [God] divided between Himself and His servant, thus affirming him.

As for his effacement in this affirmation, it is His saying: "Allah created you and what you do"¹ and His saying: "Not for you is any matter"² and His saying: "Indeed, all the matter belongs to Allah"³ and His saying: "And you did not throw when you threw, but it was Allah who threw"⁴ and His saying: "And what He has made you successors over"⁵ This is the utmost clarity from the Book of Allah: effacement in affirmation. The lover has no disposal except in what he is disposed in, his Truth has compelled him: that he desires nothing but what is desired for him, and the Reality in the actual matter accepts nothing else, and everything that flows from him is Allah's creation, and he is acted upon, not an actor. He is the locus where matters flow upon him, thus he is effacement in affirmation.

Allah is the Lover: effacement in affirmation. The eye perceives only the servant's action: this is the effacement of the Real. Yet rational proof and unveiling yield only the existence of the Real, not the existence of the servant, nor of the cosmos: this is the affirmation of the Real. Thus He is effacement in the world of witnessing, affirmation in the presence of beholding.

* * *

## Attribute and Manifestation: Description of the Lover as Having Prepared Himself for What His Beloved Desires of Him:

This is because when the lover is veiled from seeing the causes, and his gaze remains fixed only on the threshold of his Beloved—exalted is He—he carries what the world needs from him, and he must, in reality, render to it what it demands from him of its rights. As he [the Prophet] ﷺ said: "Your visitor has a right upon you." He thus presented what encompasses the entire world, which is visitation. This is among his comprehensive words.

So this lover prepares himself for what his Beloved desires of him, and he knows what rights the world has upon him, from the perspective of what his Beloved desires of him in terms of his employment in what He employs him. The Real is All-Wise: He moves him only in pure action, and the fulfillment of rights.

# The Special One in what is sought from him by those of the world in that time, so he knows the world from God, and returns to witnessing the Truth. This is the saying of the Truthful One [Abu Bakr]: "I did not see anything except that I saw God before it." Thus he witnessed the essence of the world in witnessing God.

# The Lover of God: Since, in reality, the Truth—Glory be to Him—does not accept manipulation in His Essence, and He has placed in the souls of the world the need for Him in what contains their compatibility, welfare, and fulfillment of their purposes. It is as if He has prepared Himself for all that they want from Him and what they want through Him. For this reason, when they ask Him for something whose time has not yet come, He says to them: "I shall devote Myself to you."¹ He is the Actor in every circumstance, and His Essence is not a place for the manifestation of effects; thus the understanding has occurred that He is a lover of what the cosmos needs, not for Himself. And in everything He has brought into existence there is glorification: it is the nourishment of that existent thing. For this reason, He—Glory be to Him—has informed that there is nothing except that it glorifies Him with praise. And We have mentioned this in the station of futuwwa [spiritual chivalry].

# A Subtle Point and Illustration: The lover is characterized as having interpenetrating attributes:

That is because the lover seeks connection with the beloved, and seeks to follow the will of the beloved. Yet the beloved may desire what contradicts connection, thus the attributes of the lover have interpenetrated in such a case.

# The Lover of God: He is the First from the very essence of what is the Last: His lastness has entered into His firstness, and His firstness has entered into His lastness, and there is nothing but His essence. His firstness is His essence, and His lastness is His servant; and that is His beloved. Thus His attributes have interpenetrated with the attributes of His beloved. If you say: "Servant," you have not been pure. And if you say: "Master," you have not been pure. Yet you are truthful in both matters. This is the rule of interpenetration.

***

# A Subtle Point and Illustration: The lover is characterized as having no ease with his beloved:

This means: he has no rest with his beloved, because he is vigilant of his beloved. In every breath he sees where his position is, and directs himself accordingly. Thus he remains in continuous struggle, exerting utmost effort in pleasing the beloved, while the beloved's pleasure remains unknown, so there is no rest for the lover. This is

# The meaning of their saying: "He has no breath" that is, he gets no rest from providing relief, which is the removal of distress and hardship. This is the attribute of the sincere lover in his love.

God as Lover: His saying: "Every day He is engaged in some affair"¹ He acts only in relation to His servants, and from His servants He intends only His beloveds. The rest are excluded except through dependency: they eat the leftovers from their tables. He occupies Himself with their interests in this world and the next. However, He is described as not being touched by fatigue. The Exalted says: "And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, and no fatigue touched Us"² And this is His saying: "Were We exhausted by the first creation? Rather, they are in confusion about a new creation"³ meaning that in every breath He—the Exalted—is in a new creation regarding His servants, which is His saying: "Every day He is engaged in some affair."

And He said concerning the people of happiness: "No fatigue shall touch them therein"⁴ despite their being in every state engaged in God's right, not in the right of their own souls. Then indeed this returns to them, though they do not intend it for the sake of its return to them; rather, the realities necessitate this. For this reason, the lover is described as having no breath with his beloved.

* * *

And some say: The attribute of the lover is that he is entirely for his beloved:

This is because he is a collective, and the rule of his collectivity manifests his essence. His singularities are for God, since Oneness belongs to God, and the collective is nothing but these singularities; thus he is entirely for God. For each one of the collective, when multiplied by the True One, the product is the True One. This is the meaning of "he is entirely for his beloved." He is the oneness of the collective, for the collective has a oneness.

And on this basis it follows that when the lover is God, then the entirety in relation to God, with His Oneness, is only the Divine Names. And they are the ninety-nine. Thus multiplicity appears in the Names, so it became the name of the entirety. And the singularities of this entirety are: from each name individually, that name demands from the servant a single reality through which its authority manifests, and no

Translation of Ibn Arabi text from the Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya:

...exists only as one. So the one is multiplied by the one, and there appears in the witness one of number, and that is the beloved;

So all of it belongs to God. Because all the Names manifest their rulings in the servant, and the Names belong to God. Thus, everything is for the beloved servant in God's sight.

There is nothing for it in the Divine Presence except for the beloved servant, for God in His Essence is independent of the worlds, and He is independent of multiplicity and of being indicated.

* * *

Platform and Summary: The description of the lover is that he reproaches himself, by himself, regarding the rights of his beloved:

This is because the lover sees that he falls short of fulfilling the rights his beloved has over him, which his love has made obligatory upon him, and he has no knowledge encompassing his beloved's domain. So he strives to act according to what he knows of that, then says to himself: "If you were truthful in your love, all of his desires would be revealed to you, for you are in the abode of obligation; which is a limited abode, and the beloved's desires therein are specified¹, unlike the Hereafter where your sight will be unrestricted, because it is entirely his desires, so there is no reproach there." For this reason, the lover reproaches himself by himself regarding the rights of his beloved.

The Lover of God: He described Himself as hesitating regarding His love for the believing servant, since it is the right of the beloved that the lover should not do to him what he dislikes, and the beloved dislikes death, and the Real dislikes displeasing him insofar as He loves him.

This is the meaning of reproach, and death is inevitable for him, due to what preceded in knowledge; but this is because of the servant's ignorance of the good that awaits him in the encounter. Unlike the lovers; for they love death not for rest, but for meeting with the beloved. And among the lovers are those who are overcome by the pleasure of the beloved, and who see that this is not achieved in a state by which the degree of the lover's love is known except through the existence of limitation, and the distinction between what pleases and what displeases—and this only exists for him in the abode of obligation, whereas in the Hereafter there is no limitation. Thus, equality occurs, and the distinction of the lover's degree in his conduct from the non-lover is removed. So some lovers dislike death for this reason, and this is due to their truthfulness in love.

And the Lover of God is also in this reality, having decreed death for all, and it was the purpose of this special group who desire distinction that the limitation not be lifted from them, so that they might know the degree of their love for their master over others.

...the groups, and what remains will be knowledge of what is to be, only when it comes to be. This degree is called "reproach" with respect to the Truth, distinguished by His saying: "Doer of what He intends"¹, no, rather it distinguishes Him and specifically chooses. And what is also understood from His saying: "And if He had willed"².

So this and its like necessitate reproach, not will nor knowledge, for the judgment belongs to it. Be attentive to what we have mentioned.

All these are divine secrets which our companions have jealously guarded, when they perceived their immense value, and it is as they have said. Except that what we have revealed of them, in relation to our knowledge of God, is but a husk. This is the reason for our venturing to reveal it, and for the benefit it contains for the servants.

* * *

Crafting and Manifestation: The Lover is Wearied by Being Bewildered in Astonishment:

Astonishment is caused by the manifestation of the Beloved, which is expressed as "the sudden arrival." There will be a chapter about this in this book.

When the Truth called the hearts of the servants to Him, and prescribed for them the connective lawful path, and made Himself known to them through indications so they recognized Him, and endeared Himself to them through blessings so they loved Him. Then when He manifested to them unexpectedly as they entered upon Him, while they were unaware they were in a state of entering upon Him, for they are His manifestation. They recognized Him by the sign, and they were astonished by the suddenness of the manifestation and the praise, due to their knowledge of the sign within themselves, that He is their beloved and their sought one. This is their delight in astonishment.

The Lover of God: He described Himself as having choice, and that He has power over all things, and that if He willed He would do, and that no one compels Him, and He is the Truthful in His word and in what He has judged upon Himself, and He is also "the Affirmer." Thus, matters are arranged in the arrangement of wisdom, "None can reverse His judgment"³, for in every state He does what is appropriate as it is appropriate for what is appropriate. The action of a Wise One, Knower of ranks. So the questions⁴ of the questioners come to Him, and what corresponds to the timing of the response in the very thing they asked about. It is established that no one compels Him. Yet there must be a pause at this question due to its contradiction—if He were to answer it—to the arrangement of wisdom. This degree is called astonishment.

===== page_95 =====


As for that which is effective; the petitioner in this matter is beloved; for He loves his asking and supplication, as has been reported in the tradition:

"That two persons: one beloved to God and one detested, both asked God for something they needed. So God revealed to the angel to fulfill the need of the detested one quickly—so that he would cease from his asking, because He detests him and detests his voice. And He says to the angel: 'Delay fulfilling the need of so-and-so, for I love to hear his voice and his asking, for I love him.'" So this one's need is fulfilled despite being detested, and this one's need is unfulfilled despite being loved and cared for. If this secret were to be unveiled to the beloved at the time when the response is delayed, nothing could contain his joy at that. So the delay in responding is like the hesitation of one astonished by the truthfulness of his statement that he has nothing compelling him, and the delight in his knowledge that what he seeks must inevitably reach him, and his joy in it. Glory be to the Mighty, the Wise.

A Note and an Appendix: Regarding one who argues that he has transgressed the limits after preserving them:

This is specified concerning the revival of the people of Badr, for they are among those who transgressed the limits after preserving them. So He said to them: "Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you." As for those not specifically designated in general terms, yet who are specifically designated in particular terms, God has specified their attributes, as God—glorified be He—mentioned in His saying: "A servant committed a sin and knew that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for sins." Then He said in the fourth or third instance: "Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you." Thus He permitted him, and removed him from restriction in this world, since God does not command indecency. So the possessor of this attribute does not disobey God, but rather conducts himself in what God has permitted him. Previously, before having this attribute, he was among the people of limits, transgressing them after preserving them. So this is what the nobility of knowledge has given him, along with the presence of the intellect of legal responsibility. Unlike the possessor of a spiritual state; for the ruling concerning the possessor of a state is like the ruling for the insane person from whom the pen is lifted, so nothing is written: neither for him nor against him. But for this one, it is written for him but not against him. This is the extent of the difference between knowledge and state, how noble is knowledge! So the lover, if he is a possessor of knowledge, is more complete than if he were a possessor of a state. The state in this worldly abode is deficiency, but in the Hereafter is completion. Knowledge here is completion, and in the Hereafter

# Complete and More Complete:

The lover of God: It is [established] for us regarding those who are lovers among His servants that they do not demand from God what He has obligated upon Himself for them. They have transcended the limits after preserving them, so He gave them what He obligated upon Himself, which is preserving these limits, then He gave them without measure; and this is exceeding the limits. For the limit (is) the good deed multiplied by ten up to seven hundred times, and exceeding the limits is the increase, in His saying: "For those who do good is the best [reward]"¹ which is preserving the limit "and more"¹ which is what exceeds the limit: "This is Our gift, so grant or withhold without account."²

An Egg and a Tower: The attribute of the lover that he is jealous over his beloved on his behalf:

This is the most truthful [attribute] found regarding one who loves God. This is the station of the wayfarer (al-Subli), led to it by the magnification of his beloved in his soul, and the insignificance of his own worth. He saw that the familiarity of lovers is not befitting that noble, mighty presence; for indeed lovers have a certain familiarity in the divine presence; except for lovers characterized by poverty, for they have no familiarity, due to what overwhelms them of [divine] greatness; they are the ones characterized by contingency. And its cause is poverty. And poverty is one of the attributes of love. Thus they do not appear to the world as being among the lovers.

This is the station of the Messenger of God ﷺ for he described himself as "more jealous than Sa'd" after describing Sa'd as jealous. So he followed the ultimate hyperbole regarding Sa'd's jealousy, then mentioned that he ﷺ was "more jealous than Sa'd." He concealed his love—and what existence it had in him—through joking, playing with children, and showing his love for those he loved among his wives, children, and companions. All this was from the category of jealousy, and his saying: "I am only a human being."³ He did not consider himself to be among the lovers.

His action was natural, and it was imagined that whenever she saw him walking in her right, or preferring her; she did not know that this was by the command of his beloved to him. So it was said: Muhammad ﷺ loves Aisha, Hasan, and Husayn, and he left the Friday sermon and descended to them when he saw them stumbling in their garments, and he brought them up with him, and completed his sermon. All this is from the category of jealousy.

[Al-Shams: 29]¹
[Sad: 39]²
[Al-Kahf: 110]³

55

===== page_97 =====

Upon the Beloved is that His sanctity be violated, and that this should be the case in veneration of the Most Holy Presence that is to be recognized, yet this respect is not manifested from creation. Thus, He lowered the veil of jealousy in the hearts of His loving servants.

The Lover of God: He ﷺ said in this hadith: "And God is more jealous than I am, and from His jealousy He has forbidden obscenities"
so that those who are deluded in their claim of loving Him may be exposed. He is jealous that the false claimant would make the same claim as the truthful one, when there is no scale to distinguish between the two claims, so He forbade obscenities. Whoever claims to love Him stands at His limits; thus the truthful is distinguished from the false. And all subsist through God, so He is jealous for His beloved from himself; He attributes actions to Himself, not to the servants, so that no deficiency is attributed to the servant.

* * *

A Flash and Reasoning: It is established that the lover governs his love according to the measure of his intellect:

Because his intellect binds him, so his intellect restricts him. The Most High addresses only those of intellect, who are those bound by their attributes, distinguishing them from the attributes of their Creator. When distinction occurred, restriction resulted, and thus was intellect. For this reason, proofs of intellects distinguish between the Real and the servant, the Creator and the created. Whoever stands with his intellect, in the state of his love, cannot accept from the authority of love except what his theoretical proof requires. And whoever stands with the acceptance of his intellect, not with the consideration of his intellect, accepts from the Real what He has described Himself with, and the authority of love governs him according to¹ what his intellect has accepted of that. So intellect is between consideration and acceptance. Thus, the rule of love in the considering and accepting intellect is not the same. Understand, for herein lie secrets.

The Lover of God: The relation of intellect to us (is like) the relation of knowledge to Him, so nothing occurs except what His knowledge has preceded. Just as nothing occurs from us except to the extent that our intellect demands it. So the governance of His love in His creation does not exceed His knowledge, and the governance of our love in Him does not exceed our intellect; whether in consideration or acceptance, understand.

# Platform and Meaning: The Description of the Lover as Being Like One Astray, Whose Wound is Uncompensated:

It is narrated that a swallow and the offspring of a female swallow were in a dome belonging to Solomon, peace be upon him, while Solomon was inside the dome.

He heard the male saying to the female: "My love for you has reached such an extent that if you asked me to demolish this dome upon Solomon, I would do it!"

Solomon, peace be upon him, summoned him and said: "What is this that I heard from you?" The swallow replied: "O Solomon, do not hasten to judge me; the lover has a tongue with which only madness speaks, and I love this female; so I said what you heard. Lovers cannot be held accountable, for they speak with the tongue of Paradise, not with the tongue of knowledge and reason." Solomon laughed, showed mercy to him, and did not punish him. This was a wound he rendered uncompensated, disregarded and did not hold against him. Such is love for God: all the apparent deficiencies that arise from the humiliation of love and the sincerity of affection, the lover is not held accountable for them; for that is the ruling of love, and love removes reason, and God only holds accountable those of sound mind, not the insane: for they are under His command, and subject to the authority of love's sovereignty.

**The lover of God: his wound is uncompensated.** He is the truthful one, and He threatens punishment for sin as He threatens, then pardons and does not hold accountable without repentance from the sinner, but rather through grace and favor. So He disregards what He had the right to punish, making what the wrongdoer committed uncompensated, and the retribution with which the Truth threatened him uncompensated; because He pardoned him without cause. Awe does not intend harm to servants nor is it rational, so its wound is uncompensated. Love is ruled upon; its defeat is what kills; so its wound is uncompensated. "And to Allah belongs the conclusive argument. Had He willed, He would have guided you all."⁴

**Platform and Meaning: The Description of the Lover as One Whose Love Neither Increases with the Kindness of the Beloved nor Decreases with Aloofness:**

This condition only occurs in love that is loved for its own essence; from a manifestation revealed to him from His name "the Beautiful," so it neither increases with kindness, nor decreases with aversion. Unlike love based on beneficence and favors, which accepts increase and decrease, and is a love that is contingent. The female lover said: "Even if you cut me into pieces, piece by piece, I would only increase in love for you," meaning our love would not decrease because of that, and this is the saying of the female lover. It is said that this is the saying of the famous Rabi'a al-Adawiyya who was adorned

Upon men in state and station, and she has been favored and exalted—may God be pleased with her—and it is one of the most wondrous ways of expressing love:

I love you with two loves: love of passion        And a love because you are worthy of it
As for that which is love of passion        It is my occupation with your remembrance, away from all others
And as for that which you are worthy of        It is your unveiling of the veils until I see you
So no praise is due to me in this or that        But to you is all praise in this and that

And another woman said, the servant girl of 'Attab the scribe:

O beloved of hearts, who do I have but you        Today a visitor has come crowding to you
You are my request, my desire, and my joy        The heart has refused to love anyone but you
O my aspiration, my master, and my reliance        Long has been my yearning, when will our meeting be?
Except that I desire it only to see you        My request from Paradise is not its bliss

And we have in this description:

Your bliss or your torment are the same to me        For your covenant neither changes nor increases
My judgment is in what you choose of me        And your love, like your creation of me, is ever new

This is the station of equilibrium, and it is the divine station: contingencies do not affect it, nor is it influenced by states.

The lover of God: is neither pleased by obedience, nor harmed by disobedience. Whoever of His servants He loves, sins do not harm him, nor detract from his station, rather He supports him and says: "God has pardoned you. Why did you give them permission?" Thus He placed pardon before questioning according to us, and before reproach according to others; "That God may forgive you what preceded of your sin and what will follow." Thus He placed forgiveness before sin. And it is not a sin in His view; He only mentioned it so that divine solicitude for His beloved ones might be known: there is no sin for the beloved, nor

# The Excellence of Love in Itself

Despite all this, it is a hidden station, not manifest, quick to fluctuate in love, wherein demands with every breath are conceived. One who claims this station must preserve its balance; if he fails to maintain it, evidence will be established against him from both sides. None can preserve it except one of complete knowledge and truthful love, powerful in authority and firm in judgment.

* * *

## Platform and Manifestation: The Lover's Insistence That He Is Not Bound by Proprieties:

Only one who possesses intellect is required to observe proper conduct, while the lover is infatuated, his intellect confounded, having no self-governance. Thus, he is not held accountable for anything that issues from him.

When the Lover is God: He is the Great, the Owner, the Establisher of proprieties for the rational beings, the Educator of His friends. As the Prophet ﷺ said: "Indeed Allah educated me and perfected my education." One does not say: the master observes propriety with his servant; rather, one says: the master gives what is deserved to the servant who is beloved to him and honored by him, as a favor and grace. The master is not required to observe propriety with his servant, even if he loves him.

* * *

## Platform and Manifestation: The Lover's Insistence That He Has Forgotten His Portion and His Beloved:

Love has overwhelmed him so that he has forgotten the beloved and forgotten himself; this is the love of love. The divine reality from which this reality has issued cannot be spoken. Yes, it can be spoken, but it is among the secrets that should not be divulged. Whoever unveils it knows it, but is not permitted to make it known. Its confirmation from the Book of Allah is: "They forgot Allah, so He forgot them"², and whoever forgets his form forgets himself.

# Platform and Manifestation: The Lover Described as One Stripped of Attributes:

The lover has no attribute by which he is bound, nor any quality, for he is at the point where his beloved wishes to annihilate him within himself. His enchantment is what is intended for him, and what is intended for him, he does not know. Thus, he is one stripped of attributes.

**The Lover of God**: He is perfect in his essence, not perfected by anything additional. He has no attribute nor quality, for ﴿There is nothing like unto Him﴾¹ ﴿Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, above what they describe﴾².

* * *

# Platform and Manifestation: The Lover Described as One of Unknown Names:

The poet said³:

Do not call me except with "O" alone        For it is my most noble name

This is like their saying about him: he is stripped of attributes. Servitude is essential to him. He has no specific name except what his beloved names him. By whatever name his beloved calls him and summons him, he responds and answers. So when the lover is asked: "What is your name?" he says: "Ask the beloved; whatever he names me, that is my name. I have no name, I am the unknown who is not known, the indefinite that is not defined⁵."

**The Lover of God**: He has no name that indicates his essence. Rather, the divinity, who is his beloved, looks at what effect He has in him, and names him by his effects, and the Real accepts what he names Him. The one who takes God as divine says: "O Allah." Allah says to him: "At your service." The lorded-over says: "O Lord." The Lord says to him: "At your service." The created says to Him: "O Creator." The Creator says: "At your service." The provided-for says: "O Provider." The Provider says: "At your service." The weak one says: "O Strong One." The Strong One says: "I answer you." Thus our states call Him with a call of realization; and He takes them⁶ as names. This is why their expressions differ, and the composition of their letters varies according to the language. But the meaning that necessitates the name is understood among created beings. So the Arab says: "O Allah" to the same one the Persian calls: "O Khudā"; and says to Him

The Roman says: Ilishma; and the Armenian says: Ei udtaj; and the Turk calls upon Him: Ei tengri; and the Frank calls upon Him: Ei creator; and the Abyssinian says to Him: Faq. These are different expressions for one meaning intended by every created being. For this reason we say: His Names are unknown. Since names are indicators, the Sought One answers His lover by whatever name he calls.

* * *

Note and example: The lover is described as appearing distracted but is not distracted:
This quality is called: bewilderment and fixation. He only has this state during immersion in what he has of love for his beloved. To the extent that his beloved might be right in front of him yet he does not recognize him, and calls to him but does not recognize his voice despite looking at him. So he is like one distracted in his state, while he is in the utmost infatuation with him.

The Divine Lover says: "And Allah is self-sufficient, independent of the worlds"² yet He requires from them their every breath to be in His remembrance, and He is "the Hearer of Prayer."³

* * *

Note and example: The lover is described as not distinguishing between union and separation:
Due to his preoccupation with what he has of his beloved; for his beloved is his constant witness. Or he may be as one has said:⁴

The night when she connects is like the night when she abandons     I complain of its length as I complain of its brevity

So in both states he is one who complains, due to the changing of his condition; in perpetual torment. As for us, we follow the first approach, we have no occupation except with Him. He is our witnessed One: we know none other than Him, and we witness none but Him. And we have regarding this:

My occupation is with her; whether she connects at night or abandons     I do not care if the night is long or short

# The Lover of God: The Divine Word is One. He, the Exalted, said: {And Our command is but one, like the twinkling of an eye} No

proximity exists with Him: His distance is the essence of His proximity, and His proximity is the essence of His distance; thus He is the Distant-Near. With Him there is no connection to us that would accept separation, nor distinction that would accept connection.

Between union lies the essence of separation within Him    
And none knows this except one who has seen Him

## A Platform and Gathering: Concerning the Lover, That He Dwells in Familiarity:

The letter mīm (refers to) the one who is bound by love and humbled by it, yet with a familiarity he finds within himself whose cause he does not know, except for what the realities bestow—that love gives the beloved mastery over him; it is as if he has appointed him as guardian. Whoever is in this state must emanate a scent of familiarity within humility and submission. This is what the station of love bestows.

# The Lover of God: "My servant; you were hungry but did not feed Me, you were thirsty but did not give Me drink, I was sick but you did not visit Me." "Whoever draws near to Me by a hand's span, I draw near to him by an arm's length." Thus proximity is multiplied {Who is it that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him, and he will have a generous reward}¹ Thus the multiplication of reward is familiarity, and the question remains a question.

* * *

## A Platform and Gathering: Concerning the Lover² That He Possesses Confusion:

The cause of this is his ignorance of what is in the beloved's soul; he does not know in what state he should be with him. Indeed, when the Truth is his beloved, he has come to know this through what has been prescribed for him, so no confusion remains in his heart, except concerning what has been withheld from him of secrets, and what has been bestowed upon him of subtleties. He wishes to draw him to His creation so that all aspirations and hearts gather upon him, but this is not possible except by broadcasting his secrets, for souls are inherently disposed to love gifts, endowments, and offerings. Then, he does not know: would broadcasting these secrets please his Lord or not? This is the cause of confusion in the hearts of those who love God.

# The Lover of God:

The divine command was enacted that He should prefer¹ the one whom His foreknowledge deemed would not believe, and His word and knowledge are one. From what reality, then, did He command one whom He knew would not comply with His command, thus exposing him to disobedience, ﴿And He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing﴾². From here arose the confusion in the world, and the divergence of purposes and disputes.

## Platform and Manifestation: The Lover Delights in Being Beyond Measure:

Actions based on the measure considered in wisdom require sound thought. But love has no thought³ in managing the cosmos; rather, its concern and occupation is with the remembrance of its beloved. Imagination has exceeded all bounds in it, so it knows no measures. If one's beloved is God, when the heart cannot contain Him, that is what is beyond measure⁴, for nothing can weigh it. Do you not see how the utterance of His remembrance, which is the phrase: "There is no god but God," does not enter the scales, but rather its record enters, in terms of how it is written in the scales for the owner of the registers, the registers are outweighed, and its weight is nothing, and if all varieties of the world were placed [against it], they would not outweigh it. And this is a phrase from one who has not been characterized by love, so what do you think of the speech of a lover?! What do you think of his state?! What do you think of his heart, which is more vast than the mercy of God?! And its vastness is only from the mercy of God?! This is among the most wondrous things that have appeared in existence: that the expansiveness of the heart comes from God's mercy, yet it is more vast than God's mercy. Abu Yazid says: "If the Throne and all that it contains were multiplied a hundred thousand thousand times in a corner of the corners of the knower's heart, he would not sense it." So what of the state of the lover?!

# The Lover of God:

He transcends comparison. The beloved of the Real is with the Real, for the lover does not separate from his beloved, ﴿And what is with God remains﴾⁵, so the beloved remains. And what remains is not comparable to what perishes.

Noble Aspect and Manifestation: I have characterized the lover as one who says of himself: "I am the very essence of my beloved" due to his consumption in the beloved, thus he does not see the beloved as other than himself.
One of them said regarding this:
I am the one whom I desire, and the one whom I desire is I
And this is the state of Abu Yazid.

God the Lover: He loved some of His servants and thus became their hearing, their sight, their tongue, and all their faculties.

* * *

Noble Aspect and Manifestation: I have characterized the lover as being consumed and exerting all effort:
He does not say to his beloved: "Why did you do this?" or "Why did you say that?" Anas ibn Malik said: "I served the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for ten years. He never said to me regarding something I did: 'Why did you do it?' Nor regarding something I did not do: 'Why did you not do it?'" This is because he saw the dispensation of his beloved in him. The beloved's dispensation in the lover is not questioned, but rather accepted, or rather, found delightful. For the lover is consumed by a fire that burns everything it finds in his heart other than his beloved, out of jealousy. Thus he exerts all effort, yet does not consider that he has succeeded, nor does it occur to him that he has moved in a way that pleases his beloved.

God the Lover: In this domain, not an atom moves except by His permission, so how could He say "Why?" when none has acted but Him?
The Truth says to His beloved: "I have given what is necessary." For every beloved has a manifestation that belongs to no other, so two are never united with Him, nor could they be. This is consumption. And describing him as one who exerts all effort (refers to) what is attributed to Him of hesitation.

Noble Aspect and Manifestation: I have characterized the lover as having his veil torn: his secret is public, the scandal of the age, he knows not concealment. The truthful lover said:²

Whoever claims that he will conceal his love
Until it causes doubt about him, he is a liar
Love's conquest of the heart through its force is greater
Than to allow any portion for concealment therein

# English Translation:

And when the secret of sin appears, it
   Does not appear except when the youth is overcome
I envy the one with guarded passion
   Not concerned with eyes and hearts

Love is overpowering: it leaves no secret without violating it, and no confidence without revealing it. Its sleepless nights escalate, and its tears follow in succession.

His limbs testify against him by the ailments and sleeplessness they bear, and his states betray him. If he speaks, he speaks of that which cannot be conveyed. He has neither patience nor endurance. His worries come one after another, and his sorrows are multiplied.

**The Beloved of God**: When God loves a servant, He reveals to the angel to proclaim in the heavens: "God loves so-and-so, so love him." Then the inhabitants of heaven love him, and acceptance is placed for him on earth. The inner realities accept him, even if the outer appearances of some people deny him due to motives they harbor. In this matter, it is not like their prostration to God: "Everyone in the universe prostrates to God ﴾and many among people﴿¹" - He did not say "all of them." And so is the love for this servant in their hearts.

And if acceptance is placed for him on earth, then all regions of earth love him, and everything within them. ﴾And many among people﴿ remain upon their original state regarding prostration to God, equally.

* * *

**Awakening and Manifestation**: The lover is described as one who does not know he is a lover, full of longing yet knows not for whom! Great in ecstasy yet knows not for whom! He does not feel jealousy for his beloved!

Excessive proximity is a veil. He experiences the effects of love while being clothed in the image of his beloved, which governs his imagination. So he seeks him externally, but cannot find what he embraced of his form within himself, due to the density of the apparent compared to the subtlety of the hidden.

The lover is with the meaning that he takes from the beloved and elevates within himself. That elevated meaning with the lover is what transports and elevates him. It is within him yet he does not know it is within him, so he seeks it only through it. The subtle disappears from the senses. He speaks but does not comprehend what he says, nor his statement: "My heart is with my beloved."

My heart is lost, where shall I seek it?
   I do not see my body as its homeland.

Neither in saying: "My beloved is in my heart." I do not know in which of the two states he is more truthful, combining between opposites: He is with me, He is not with me.

The Lover of God: God manifested Himself to Adam with His hands clenched. He said: "O Adam, choose whichever you wish." Adam said: "I choose the right hand of my Lord, though both hands of my Lord are blessed right hands." So He opened it, and behold, in it were Adam and his progeny¹. Thus Adam is within the grasp, and Adam is outside the grasp. This is the image of the beloved with the lover: He is in him, He is not in him.

His attributes are numerous beyond enumeration, and they have no limit that can be reached through investigation and inquiry. However, the sources of love are diverse according to the differences of the beloved. If you understand what I mean, then I have placed you on the path, so beware of anthropomorphism².

Ecstasy (wajd), love (ḥubb), longing (shawq), and grief (kamad) are one reality with different relations due to the differences in their objects. They are attributes that rule by their authority over the one in whom they arise. No attribute returns from them to the beloved, nor does the beloved have any ruling in them, unless the beloved is also a lover. Understand this.

This much is sufficient, in brevity, regarding the description of lovers on both sides ﴾And Allah speaks the truth and guides to the way﴿³.
