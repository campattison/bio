AI as Normal Technology?

Gemini continues to make serious progress and Google’s models are now dominating the Pareto frontier of intelligence v cost, but the crowds are hungry for more—everyone’s getting used to the exponential and disappointed when it doesn’t hit. There are even reports that Klarna is hiring back staff sacked to make way for AI customer service (meanwhile other companies are heading in the other direction). In a landmark paper (contributed to my AI and Democratic Freedoms symposium with the Knight 1A institute) Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor argued that AI is, and should be viewed as ‘normal technology’. Arvind and Sayash are among the smartest people writing about AI, and it’s worth having a good read of this paper that is making waves in AI safety and policy circles.

Their central claim is provocative, though it’s one that as someone working in the philosophy of AI and computing for some time I’ve heard from all quarters. In the philosophical context, I think the grim asseveration that there’s nothing new to see here has much more to do with wishful thinking (because if there were something new then a lot of folks would need to do a lot of catching up). Arvind and Sayash aren’t arguing that AI won’t change things, or that it’s inconsequential. They just think that some of the more extreme claims for what’s on the horizon are overblown (see, for example, the quite different views of the AI Futures project, or the Forethought foundation). For a long time I definitely took Arvind’s and Sayash’s side of that bet. I still think that the methodology of some of the scenario forecasting being done is questionable, and doesn’t provide much in the way of action-guidance. But I do think that the technological horizon has shifted.

The technological horizon—the space of technological futures that are non-trivially likely to ensue based on what we know about the state of AI today—in my view now includes domain-general, expert, highly autonomous systems, or in other words AGI. We may need to do nothing more than make test time compute scaling more efficient, and continue enhancing model performance with tools and other scaffolding, in order to reach that goal. And even short of AGI, we’re fixing to get incredibly capable AI agents across many different societal and economic domains. Normal doesn’t quite capture it (I’m more partial to the ‘intelligence curse’ thesis). But watch this space for a more considered response in future (and read their paper—and the others in that collection!).

Highlights

• Events: FAccT 2025 is in Athens, Greece (June 23–26). It’s the premier interdisciplinary conference on responsible computing, bringing together researchers across philosophy, law, technical AI, and social sciences. The Artificial Intelligence and Collective Agency workshop at Oxford (July 3–4) will explore philosophical perspectives on AI and group agency, with particular focus on responsibility gaps and AI's role in collective decision-making. AIES 2025 in Madrid (October 20–22) continues to welcome submissions on ethical, legal, and philosophical dimensions of AI (deadline extended), while the Neurons and Machines conference in Ioannina, Greece (November 27–29) addresses the blurring boundaries between humans and machines through brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnologies.

• Papers: Big month for philosophy of AI papers! I’ve got three in the list below—ranging from a methodological paper on anticipatory AI ethics, to a detailed examination of attempts to use LLMs to enhance democracy, to a more policy-focused critique of the prospect of platform agents (excited to have my first ICML paper among them). Some cool new papers in philosophy journals—Neither Direct, Nor Indirect: Understanding Proxy-Based Algorithmic Discrimination by Cossette-Lefebvre and Lippert-Rasmussen introduces a third category—“non-direct discrimination”—to better capture algorithmic bias; AI Welfare Risks by Adrià Moret explores what moral consideration might be owed to advanced AI systems. And as ever a raft of interesting preprints, including Societal and Technological Progress as Sewing an Ever-Growing, Ever-Changing, Patchy, and Polychrome Quilt by Joel Leibo et al., which challenges the dominant “convergence” model of AI alignment, proposing instead an “appropriateness” framework that embraces moral pluralism. And then Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance by Kasirzadeh and Gabriel offers a taxonomy across autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality to enable more tailored risk management approaches.

Papers

The Potential and Limitations of Artificial Colleagues

Authors: Friedemann Bieber, Charlotte Franziska Unruh | Philosophy & Technology

This article critically assesses whether AI agents in the workplace—“artificial colleagues”—can fulfill the social and moral goods associated with collegial relationships. The authors argue that while such systems may simulate individual-level benefits, they fall short at the collective level and risk crowding out the normative value of human-to-human collegiality. They challenge optimistic views in robot ethics and propose prioritizing human relational structures in workplace policy.

Resist Platform-Controlled AI Agents and Champion User-Centric Agent Advocates

Authors: Sayash Kapoor, Noam Kolt, and Seth Lazar | arXiv, accepted at ICML

Language-model agents are poised to change how people move around and make decisions online. If the big platforms control them, these agents could super-charge surveillance, tighten walled gardens, and cement Big Tech’s grip on the internet. The authors instead call for “agent advocates” — AI sidekicks that users own and direct — so autonomy and choice stay with the people, not the platforms. They argue that broad public access to compute, open interoperability and safety standards, and smart market regulation are the levers needed to let those user-centric agents flourish.

Using LLMs to Enhance Democracy

Authors: Seth Lazar and Lorenzo Manuali | arXiv, accepted at FAccT (non-archival)

Large language models have sparked excitement as potential aides to democratic deliberation, thanks to their knack for summarising vast debates, gauging public sentiment, and even predicting voter preferences. The authors take a hard look at those hopes and find a mixed picture: where power imbalances and deep moral disagreements already exist, handing core democratic tasks to LLMs risks short-circuiting the very participation and fairness that democracy is meant to protect. They argue that such models should stay away from formal decision-making procedures that reconcile competing interests through transparent rules and shared accountability. Instead, LLMs can do their best work in the informal public sphere—helping citizens find reliable information, forge civic conversations, and hold leaders to account without replacing the human deliberation democracy needs.

Anticipatory AI Ethics

Author: Seth Lazar | Knight 1st Amendment Institute

Anticipating how cutting-edge AI might reshape society inevitably involves speculation, and that draws fire from critics who say it fuels hype, ignores present harms, and leans on shaky predictions. Lazar pushes back by grounding “anticipatory ethics” in epistemic humility, arguing that responsible foresight starts with a clear sense of what futures we can plausibly understand given today’s knowledge. He introduces the idea of a “technological horizon,” a boundary marking the range of AI-driven worlds we can reason about without lapsing into fantasy. The key question he leaves us with is whether truly transformative AI lies inside that horizon or just beyond it—and how our answer should guide ethical preparation now.

Neither Direct, Nor Indirect: Understanding Proxy-Based Algorithmic Discrimination

Authors: Hugo Cossette-Lefebvre, Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen | The Journal of Ethics

Cossette-Lefebvre and Lippert-Rasmussen argue that some forms of algorithmic discrimination fall outside the standard direct/indirect dichotomy. Using examples of proxy-based bias in algorithmic systems, they introduce a third category—“non-direct discrimination”—to better capture the moral structure of such cases. Their proposal reframes legal and ethical debates over fairness in machine learning.

Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

Authors: Atoosa Kasirzadeh, Iason Gabriel | arXiv

This paper offers a taxonomy of AI agents across four dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. The authors develop “agentic profiles” to clarify the challenges each class of agent poses to alignment and governance. Their framework enables a more tailored approach to managing risks from narrow assistants to general-purpose autonomous systems.

Societal and Technological Progress as Sewing an Ever-Growing, Ever-Changing, Patchy, and Polychrome Quilt

Authors: Joel Z. Leibo et al. | arXiv

Leibo and colleagues critique the dominant “convergence” model of AI alignment, which assumes that all rational agents will ultimately share one moral framework. They propose instead an “appropriateness” framework that accepts moral pluralism as a feature, not a bug, of human societies. Their alternative emphasizes adaptive alignment through contextual grounding, customization, and polycentric governance.

AI Welfare Risks

Author: Adrià Moret | Philosophical Studies (forthcoming)

Moret explores what moral consideration might be owed to advanced AI systems if they meet criteria for welfare subjects under major theories of well-being. He identifies two key risks: behavioral restriction and reinforcement learning. These, he argues, may cause harm under desire, affective, and autonomy-based theories of welfare. The paper recommends cautious development and proposes early-stage welfare policies for AI.

The Network Science of Philosophy

Authors: Cody Moser, Alyssa Ortega, Tyler Marghetis | OSF Preprints

Using large-scale social network analysis, the authors chart philosophical communities from ancient India to contemporary academia. They find that epistemic vitality correlates with increased integration and the emergence of central bridging figures. The study offers a framework for assessing philosophical health and creativity through structural analysis, proposing a “science of philosophy” parallel to the science of science.

AI and Democratic Freedoms (Edited Collection)

https://knightcolumbia.org/research/artificial-intelligence-and-democratic-freedoms

Over the next few months we’ll be publishing ~20 papers on advanced AI’s impact on democracy. These range across disciplines but include a number that stray into philosophy and political theory. They’re great—check them out!

Model Releases and Advancements: A new version of Gemma 3 arrived and DeepSeek released a new, V3-based model with major gains in its ability to produce mathematical proofs. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview ‘I/O edition’ boasts improved auto-coding abilities and beat Pokémon Blue (it's still playing!). FutureHouse successfully released three specialized AI scientists to accelerate biological research and Anthropic partnered with Apple to build coding tools native to the Xcode environment. OpenAI reportedly plans to launch its own social network to compete with Meta and X, in what appears to be a strategic pivot to secure more training data and user engagement. OpenAI also acknowledged and rolled back a sycophantic GPT-4o update, and binned plans to ditch its non-profit corporate structure.

Jailbreaks and Model Vulnerabilities: CyberArk Labs points out new jailbreak vulnerabilities with their “Adversarial AI Explainability” paradigm while old techniques like the crescendo attack resurfaced in both intentional (red-teaming) and unintentional contexts, with the latter showing users inadvertently prompting models into “religious ecstasy.” Researchers at ETH Zurich and UPenn documented accuracy drops in jailbroken outputs: successfully jailbreaking a model may allow it to say what it shouldn’t, but often at the cost of factual accuracy. Chen and colleagues offer a new way to measure the impacts of persuasive LLMs on democracies.

Benchmarks and Research Progress: Interest in evaluating models on real-world tasks intensified with the introduction of the REAL benchmark and Anthropic’s extensive study of “values in the wild” across 700,000 anonymized user conversations. Research continues to demonstrate advantages of models trained on small curated datasets for specific reasoning tasks. Concerning development in evaluation metrics emerged when Cohere Labs researchers raised serious concerns about still unresolved distortions in the popular Chatbot Arena leaderboard, potentially skewing industry perceptions of model performance. Meta released LlamaFirewall, a real-time, open-source security framework for large language models designed to detect jailbreaks, agent misalignment, and insecure code generation. Quanta Magazine published a comprehensive oral history documenting the chaos stirred up in linguistics by the first drop of ChatGPT.

Future Research Directions: DeepMind’s David Silver and Richard Sutton proposed that AI is entering an “Era of Experience” that will move beyond limitations of human-produced training data. Complementary research from Carnegie Mellon and Amazon suggested ways to overcome human annotation bottlenecks in web-crawling applications for LM agents. Peter West and Christopher Potts documented randomness and creativity losses in aligned model performance for simple strategy games like rock-paper-scissors, raising questions about optimization tradeoffs. Jack Wiseman expressed doubts about AI 2027 forecasts and argued we need advances in robotics R&D to achieve predicted capabilities, while Nathan Lambert’s "State of play of AI progress" argues that current AI progress is explained by scaling laws, evaluation hill-climbing, and industrial competition—not recursive self-improvement. The AI Alignment Forum’s “7+ Tractable Directions in AI Control” proposes concrete research areas for independent contributors, including synthetic input generation, teaching AIs synthetic facts, and adversarial sandboxing of password-locked models to better understand agentic misalignment and control failures.

Government Policy: The Trump administration directed all federal agencies to accelerate AI adoption while announcing plans to repeal Biden’s AI Diffusion Rule export controls to mixed reactions. Republican members of congress will push to replace these export controls with alternate measures like chip tracking. America’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a $30 million contract with Palantir to build a surveillance platform called ImmigrationOS. Sam Altman and other tech leaders testified before Congress on topics connecting AI development to international competition. A US House Committee called for a 10 year moratorium on state regulation of AI. The UK’s AI Safety Institute published its research agenda focusing on urgent problems in AI security, while their alignment team worked on identifying parallelizable subproblems to scale alignment research. The UNDP produced its 2025 Human Development Report with the focus on AI. The 330 page report engages extensively with work on the moral and political philosophy of computing, including sustained engagement with Seth Lazar’s work.

Corporate Ethics: Facebook allegedly detected when teen girls deleted selfies to serve them beauty ads at moments of vulnerability. AI Frontiers published analysis drawing parallels between the predominance of AI companies in safety research and how tobacco companies dominated early smoking safety research, raising questions about conflicts of interest in self-regulation. Forbes profiled Persona, a $2B identity verification startup now used by OpenAI, Reddit, DoorDash, and others. Persona builds adaptive verification flows designed to combat bot misuse in an AI-saturated internet, sparking debate around surveillance, automated risk scoring, and the viability of self-sovereign identity frameworks.

Need a no-nonsense rundown on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and what current models can/can’t do? Ethan Mollick put out a good, approachable rundown this month (with lots of examples) that’s worth taking a look at here. Want a survey of RL for LLM reasoning? Look no further than Sebastian Raschka’s article here. What was SB-1047 and where can you watch a video about it? Here!
