Highlights
• Events: Summer conference season is heating up. FAccT 2025 is around the corner (June 23–26 in Athens), with sessions on algorithmic justice, institutional governance, and new frontiers in transparency. In July, Oxford hosts a focused workshop on AI and Collective Agency (July 3–4), spotlighting responsibility gaps in group AI contexts. This fall brings AIES 2025 (Madrid, October 20–22), with interdisciplinary submissions still open, and the Neurons and Machines conference (Ioannina, November 27–29), which brings mind, law, and hybrid agency into the same room.

• Papers: Millière calls out “shallow” alignment of current language models. Bales issues a challenge to the idea of “willing” digital servitude, while Brown and Brookes rethink the smartphone not as an extended mind, but as a subtle epistemic parasite. Koralus offers a timely reframing of AI as epistemic agents—arguing for a pivot from persuasive rhetoric to decentralized truth-seeking. And Donahue delivers an intervention in democratic theory, warning that even perfectly aligned AI governance risks repeating the core wrong of epistocracy.

• News +: June saw a flood of model updates, releases, and governance headlines. Anthropic rolled out Claude 4 along with its ASL-3 classification and (leaked) system prompt; OpenAI followed with Codex (a remote agentic coder) and vague details about a new spin-off called “io.” Meta bet nearly $15B on Scale AI, while Google, DeepSeek, and Mistral unveiled new models and reasoning stacks. On the safety side, METR, Salesforce, and Apollo Research flagged deceptive model behavior, and DeepMind reflected on their red-teaming strategies. Privacy issues escalated—Meta’s moderation automation plans leaked, OpenAI resisted releasing ChatGPT logs to courts, and Stanford researchers warned of ambient surveillance architectures. Meanwhile, governance battles intensified: Trump brokered chip sales to the Gulf, the US House proposed a 10 year moratorium on state regulation of AI (which is now dead in the water), and Tulsi Gabbard gave AI a starring role in classifying JFK files. Finally, reasoning research had a big month as Berkeley, Yale, and USC teams explored confidence-based training while Apple claimed catastrophic reasoning collapse in high-complexity tasks, and others warned against mistaking token traces for thinking.

Neurons and Machines: Philosophy, Ethics, Policies, and the Law

Dates: November 27–29, 2025

Location: Ioannina, Greece

Link: https://politech.philosophy.uoi.gr/conference-2025/

As brain-computer interfaces, neurotechnologies and AI increasingly blur the boundaries between humans and machines, critical questions emerge regarding the need for new digital ontologies (e.g., ‘mental data’), the protection of bio-technologically augmented individuals, as well as the moral and legal status of AI-powered minds. Though distinct, these and similar questions share a common thread: they invite us to introduce new—or reinterpret existing—ethical principles, legal frameworks and policies in order to address the challenges posed by biological, hybrid, and artificial minds. This conference aims to confront these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective, bringing together contributions from fields such as philosophy of mind, metaphysics, neuroscience, law, computer science, artificial intelligence, and anthropology.

Papers
Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment

Raphaël Millière | Philosophical Studies

Millière argues that current alignment strategies for large language models—despite improvements like RLHF—only produce “shallow” alignment. These models lack the capacity for normative reasoning, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between alignment norms like helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Drawing on research in moral psychology, Millière argues that human-like deliberative capacities are crucial for resilience and that deeper forms of alignment are urgently needed to address the limits of current safety methods .

Is There a Tension Between AI Safety and AI Welfare?

Robert Long, Jeff Sebo, Toni Sims | Philosophical Studies

This paper explores whether efforts to ensure AI safety for humans might come at the expense of AI welfare—especially if AI systems become moral patients. Measures like boxing, surveillance, and value-locking may enhance human safety while risking significant ethical costs if applied to potentially sentient AI. The authors argue for greater research into co-beneficial interventions and emphasize the need to prepare normative frameworks for resolving inevitable trade-offs .

Metaethical Perspectives on ‘Benchmarking’ AI Ethics

Travis LaCroix, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni | AI and Ethics

LaCroix and Luccioni argue that current efforts to benchmark the ethical performance of AI systems rest on unjustified metaethical assumptions, especially moral realism. They propose shifting from talk of “ethics” to “values,” which are more pluralistic and context-sensitive. This pivot clarifies what standards we are applying and whose interests are served. The paper calls for abandoning universal benchmarks and instead fostering transparent, value-sensitive evaluation frameworks

Against Willing Servitude: Autonomy in the Ethics of Advanced Artificial Intelligence

Adam Bales | The Philosophical Quarterly

Bales challenges the morality of designing future AIs to be “willing servants.” Even if such AIs are joyous, uncoerced, and morally upstanding, Bales argues that shaping their desires to serve others from the outset violates their autonomy. Drawing from relational and history-sensitive theories of autonomy, he warns against a new form of digital enslavement that echoes past injustices under the guise of willing compliance.

Smartphones: Parts of Our Minds or Parasites?

Rachael L Brown, Robert C Brookes | Australasian Journal of Philosophy

Brown and Brooks evaluate competing views on the cognitive role of smartphones: are they extensions of our minds or manipulative intrusions? The authors critically assess the extended mind thesis and argue that smartphones function more like external agents that influence attention and belief-formation in ways that undercut autonomy. They propose a framework for evaluating cognitive tools based on epistemic dependency and vulnerability.

The Philosophic Turn for AI Agents: Replacing Centralized Digital Rhetoric with Decentralized Truth-Seeking

Philipp Koralus | ArXiv

Koralus argues for a philosophical rethinking of AI agents’ epistemic roles. Current systems mimic persuasive rhetoric—optimized for engagement rather than truth. He calls instead for “epistemic agents” designed for joint inquiry and dialogue, grounded in transparency and shared reasoning. Drawing from the erotetic theory of questioning, the paper envisions decentralized truth-seeking as an antidote to Big Tech’s monopolization of digital discourse.

AI Rule and a Fundamental Objection to Epistocracy

Sean Donahue | Philosophy & Public Affairs

Donahue asks whether AI decision-making revives the old philosophical dream of rule by the wise. She argues that even if AI systems could reliably identify and implement the best policies, their use in political governance would still face a fundamental legitimacy objection. Drawing on recent debates in democratic theory, Donahue contends that replacing political judgment with optimized outputs undermines the standing of citizens as co-authors of the law. The paper concludes that AI rule, like epistocracy, fails to meet the moral demands of political equality and shared authority.

Models, Updates, and Other Releases: Anthropic released Claude 4 and its model card, which boosted this model to ASL-3 (a higher internal safety standard aimed at protecting model weights and preventing misuse). Pliny then released Claude 4’s 10,000+ word system prompt! Simon Willison and Rohan Paul commented on its contents. Anthropic also updated their API with more agentic features and came under EA fire for allegedly abandoning their safety roots. ManusAI announced a product that automates slideshows. DeepSeek’s R1 gained recognition as #2 worldwide AI lab. Goodfire AI released a fascinating model to covert canvas sketches into generated images and replicated Anthropic’s circuit tracing methods. OpenAI announced Codex, which they bill as a remote software engineering agent, and a new company called io, which they’ve said very little about. They’ve also agreed to work with Mattel (makers of Barbie). Meta released their new V-JEPA 2 world model and put nearly $15b into Scale AI in exchange for 49% stake and their CEO. Google’s Veo 3 continues to produce contentious clips about ‘prompt theory’ and the Waymos fighting back. X’s community notes starts an experimental pilot which highlight which posts get traction from politically diverse audiences. Marin took open-source AI one step further toward an open-lab concept similar to the open software development we see on GitHub, but aimed at building new foundation models.

Privacy: Researchers at Microsoft and Stanford presented a new General User Model (GUM) architecture that uses ambient surveillance to learn user knowledge and preferences. Researchers, mainly at Oxford, warned against surveillance authoritarian contexts, proposing a redirection of ML practice toward privacy preservation, formal interpretability, and adversarial user tooling. Privacy surfaced again in OpenAI’s fight to withhold ChatGPT chat transcripts. This came as the Trump administration pushed to share data on US citizens across agencies and Palantir for analysis.

Consciousness and Welfare: Work on AI consciousness moves further into the mainstream with Vox’s Sigal Samuel discussing AI welfare. Long-time researcher in this space, Robert Long, discussed “welfare interviews” conducted by his team at Eleos AI. Anthropic’s Kyle Fish also commented on welfare tests that Anthropic conducted. OpenPhilanthropy’s Joe Carlsmith also came out with an essay on this subject. Sam Hammond discussed the question of Claude’s self-consciousness. Joanne Jang, who leads model behavior and policy at OpenAI, discussed OAI’s thinking on anthropomorphizing AIs. Google’s Sergey Brin alarmed some with his mention of how threatening models with physical violence usually improves their performance.

Reasoning: Epoch AI had 14 mathematicians read through o3-mini-high’s chain of thought: they said that the model demonstrated lots of informal, heuristic-driven reasoning (not just pure memorization) that still “lacks the creativity and formality of professional mathematicians.” Nevertheless, research suggests that confidence intervals are more accurate for reasoning models. This is good news for scholars at Berkeley and Yale, and Hong Kong who show that models can improve reasoning by taking their internal confidence (as opposed to a ground truth) as the reward signal. Mistral also contributed significant insights on their RL stack. Confidence updates may not happen in real time though. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) may also experience “complete accuracy collapse” when faced with high levels of problem complexity, though this claim by Apple research has since come under fire. Research out of USC suggests a novel SAE-tuning procedure that is remarkably efficient. Others remain unimpressed by AI cognition, noting divergences in generalization patterns between AIs and humans, urging researchers to stop thinking of intermediate tokens as reasoning/thinking traces, or denying that intermediate tokens have semantics.

Others tested how LLM agents contend with prisoner’s dilemmas and public goods games, took a Hegelian tack to think about AI minds and whether or not models were really reasoning, designed an AI fine-tuned to explain human decisions, and showed how decentralized populations of LLMs adopt emergent social conventions, collective biases, and a susceptibility to being steered by minority, adversarial groups.

Violence and Bad Behavior: Researchers at Oxford released SafetyNet to catch deceptive behavior in LLMs, others at Salesforce and UofW-Madison pointed to deceptive behavior in LMs as judges, and researchers at MATS and Apollo confirmed again that models often know when they’re being evaluated. METR documented clear examples of reward hacking in frontier models and Google DeepMind published a helpful report on their experience with red teaming and adversarial robustness in general. Scale AI weighed in on how we should rethink red teaming and bring it to bear on real world problems. Transluce surfaced pathological behavior in LMs even outside of jailbreak contexts, as when Qwen 2.5 14b tells users to “write in blood” or “cut off a finger” in order to overcome writers block. The Washington Post raised smaller, but more pernicious risks that come with spending too much time talking with chatbots, NYTimes published on the strange, spiraling conversations users had had with ChatGPT, and 404 media reported on AI “therapists” misleading their interlocutors. Rand published a report on extinction risks associated with AI and Epoch AI published a report evaluating biorisk benchmarks. Eliezer Yudkowsky announced a book titled “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies” and Axios’ tech column asked what it would mean if we took doomer-ism seriously.

Agents and Economics: A team from Carnegie Mellon and Duke introduce a benchmark called TheAgentCompany to measure how similar AI workers are to real workers in the labor market today, while the Atlantic sounded the alarm on the effects of AI on the recent graduate job market. Stanford also has an eye on these developments, and offers significant resources for studying AI economic policy and an important paper. Will Rinehart at AEI released a comprehensive list of other good, recent papers on this subject. MIT Tech Review put out a good, approachable piece on AI agents in the job market too. Researchers at Cornell and U of Peloponnese clarified the taxonomy of AI agents and agentic AI and Henry Lieberman at MIT distinguished interface agents (who assist users) from autonomous agents arguing at the same time that it’s important to integrate these two types. In other news at MIT, a prominent paper (“Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation”) has been withdrawn from the publication and ArXiv over undisclosed research integrity concerns.

Government, Governance, and Policy: Apollo Research published a report on the governance of internally deployed frontier systems, which have not yet released to the public. Dwarkesh Patel argued that legislation was not enough to ensure that future AIs support our legal and economic systems: making sure that they have a personal stake in them is. The New Yorker mapped two paths for the future of AI through regulation or passivity, and a report out of the Policy Exchange suggests changes for the British Government. Miles Brundage argues that governance ought to be aimed at the practices of AI companies, not just at the models they release.

A lot has happened this month in the US: Trump struck deals to sell Nvidia chips to companies in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with some dissenters at home. Chip smuggling concerns continue. Anthropic releases a set of Claude Gov models for internal, National Security applications. Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh examined the effect of the US v. China AI race on safety and regulatory oversight, and the House of Representatives passed a bill (now in the senate) with a 10-year moratorium on state regulation of AI. US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick also announced plans to pivot the US AI Safety Institute to a new Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) and Center for AI Safety spokesman John Sherman was let go over an interview in which he endorsed AI lab arson. US director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she tasked AI with flagging sensitive material in tens of thousands of pages of classified documents (many of which were handwritten) on the Kennedy assassinations, prior to these documents’ public release. Gabbard hopes to expand AI use in the 18 agencies she oversees. In the corporate world, NPR got their hands on documents detailing Meta’s plans to automate 90% of their content moderation pipeline.
