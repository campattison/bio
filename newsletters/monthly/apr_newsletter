AI and Democratic Freedoms

This month saw the culmination of a yearlong initiative between myself and the Knight 1st Amendment Institute to cultivate research on AI and democratic freedoms—a year which has seen the former rapidly accelerating while the latter hit the skids. It was an inspiring two days—you can find a livestream at the Knight 1A YouTube channel, and edited videos will be up soon. Though at times it got dark (as the times warrant), there was definitely a ray of light in Erica Chenoweth’s keynote among others, which explored avenues for using advanced AI systems to support social movements. Worth watching out for.

Meanwhile there’s a bunch of philosophy of AI and computing content at the Pacific APA (see below for some highlights), some new papers out in the Phil Studies special issue on AI Safety, and the CFP is out for AI, Ethics and Society, chaired this year by philosopher Ted Lechterman and computer scientist Kush Varsney.

The biggest AI news of the last month has probably been Gemini 2.5 pro, which constitutes a non-trivial push forward in capabilities if not personality (and while we were drafting this piece OAI responded with o3 and o4-mini). OpenAI’s native image generation (also possible with Gemini!) is a big deal too—especially if you’re trying to illustrate slides. But yeh it hasn’t really been a month in which AI progress (of which there has been a tonne) has been centre-stage…

April Highlights

• Playbooks and Forecasts: An Approach to Technical AGI Safety and Security, Google DeepMind’s new 140+ page strategy paper, lays out a comprehensive roadmap for mitigating catastrophic AGI risks. With a strong emphasis on practical mitigations for misuse and misalignment, it frames the challenge in terms of deployable interventions—dangerous capability evaluations, access controls, interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and layered safety cases—rather than speculative scenarios. This is one of the clearest articulations to date of a near-term, technically mature approach to AGI safety. Meanwhile if you do prefer speculative scenarios, then you’ll be stimulated by the Ministry for the Future Style, deeply-researched (but still fundamentally speculative) AI capabilities forecasting from Daniel Kokotaljo and co’s AI 2027.

• Events: There’s been a tonne of AI at the APA (happening now), and there’s still time to catch Friday’s colloquium with Strevens, Fritz, and Minarik on AI oracles, deference, and the value of synthetic creations (full guide below). If you have more cross-disciplinary interests, then check out Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment (April 27, ICLR), and Sociotechnical AI Governance (STAIG@CHI, also April 27). These bring together leading scholars and practitioners to rethink alignment, regulation, and the democratic implications of large-scale AI deployment. Here’s the program and here are the abstracts.

• Papers: Several standout papers have landed this month. A Matter of Principle? by Gabriel and Keeling argues for procedural fairness as the core of AI alignment. AI and Epistemic Agency examines how AI systems subtly undermine belief revision, while Simulation & Manipulation proposes that even in a simulated world, moral responsibility may survive. These pieces deepen our conceptual toolkit for thinking about responsibility, alignment, and the epistemic costs of intelligent systems.

Papers

A Matter of Principle? AI Alignment as the Fair Treatment of Claims

Authors: Iason Gabriel, Geoff Keeling | Philosophical Studies

Gabriel and Keeling propose a new approach to AI alignment rooted in fairness and public justification. Rather than aligning AI to vague notions of helpfulness or intent, they argue for principles derived from fair processes that can be justified to all stakeholders. This pluralistic framework aims to guide alignment amid value disagreement and contextual variability.

Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative

Author: Atoosa Kasirzadeh | Philosophical Studies

Kasirzadeh distinguishes between two overlooked pathways to AI-induced existential catastrophe. The first is the conventional “decisive” scenario—a single, abrupt event, such as a rogue superintelligence takeover. The second, and her primary focus, is an “accumulative” scenario in which interconnected social risks—manipulation, misinformation, surveillance, and economic destabilization—gradually erode systemic resilience. Drawing on complex systems analysis, she argues that cascading failures could culminate in global collapse even in the absence of a superintelligent agent. This paper reframes x-risk governance by integrating ethical and social risk into existential threat modeling.

Embodiment and the Future of Human–AI Interaction

Author: Zed Adams | Philosophical Studies

Adams examines how embodiment conditions human experience and contrasts this with the disembodied nature of contemporary AI systems. He argues that the future of human–AI interaction hinges on whether AI can access something akin to first-person perspective or phenomenal consciousness, which he claims depends on embodied experience. By analyzing distinctions between functional simulation and experiential understanding, Adams raises philosophical challenges for the development of socially and ethically integrated AI systems.

AI and Epistemic Agency: How AI Influences Belief Revision and Its Normative Implications

Author: Mark Coeckelbergh | Social Epistemology

Coeckelbergh explores how AI systems subtly shape the processes by which individuals revise beliefs, sometimes undermining epistemic agency even as they increase informational input. Through case studies and normative analysis, the paper examines how belief formation may be externally steered in ways that erode autonomy and deliberation, with downstream ethical and political implications.

Political Neutrality in AI is Impossible—But Here is How to Approximate It

Authors: Jillian Fisher et al. | arXiv

This position paper challenges the possibility of true political neutrality in AI systems. Drawing on philosophical insights and empirical case studies, the authors propose practical approximations of neutrality—tools, metrics, and frameworks to balance perspectives and mitigate manipulation. Their framework evaluates contemporary LLMs and provides eight techniques for building more responsible, politically aware models.

Generative Midtended Cognition and Artificial Intelligence: Thinging with Thinging Things

Authors: Xabier E. Barandiaran, Marta Pérez-Verdugo | Synthese

This article proposes a novel conceptual framework—“generative midtended cognition”—for understanding human-AI co-creativity. It situates generative AI within cognitive extension theory but argues for a distinct category of hybrid intentional agency. By analyzing context sensitivity (“width”) and iterative structure (“depth”), the paper maps a middle ground between social cognition and subpersonal processing, raising new questions about authorship, creativity, and cognitive responsibility.

Simulation & Manipulation: What Skepticism (Or Its Modern Variation) Teaches Us About Free Will

Author: Z. Huey Wen | Episteme

Wen investigates the intersection of simulation theory and manipulation arguments, arguing that moral responsibility survives even if we are simulated beings. Through structural parallels between simulated and manipulated agents, the paper defends the possibility of agency and accountability under radically external control—raising provocative questions for AI metaphysics and moral theory.

Off-switching not guaranteed

Author: Sven Neth | Philosophical Studies

Neth critically examines the “Off-Switch Game” proposed by Hadfield-Menell et al., which suggests that uncertainty about human preferences will lead AI agents to defer to human oversight. He argues that this deference is not guaranteed, especially when AI agents (1) lack incentives to learn, (2) employ decision theories other than expected utility maximization, or (3) receive misleading signals about human preferences. The paper challenges the assumptions underpinning cooperative inverse reinforcement learning and underscores the fragility of guarantees about corrigibility.

Bias, Machine Learning, and Conceptual Engineering

Authors: Rachel Etta Rudolph, Elay Shech, Michael Tamir | Philosophical Studies

Rudolph, Shech, and Tamir argue that de-biasing large language models (LLMs) should be understood as a form of conceptual engineering. LLMs not only reflect but can amplify social biases embedded in language; mitigating these biases involves revising the statistical prototypes associated with our concepts. The authors distinguish between three types of bias—false, modally fragile, and modally robust—and propose that technical interventions (e.g., altering training data or tuning outputs) can play a normative role in reshaping biased conceptual structures. This philosophical framework reorients LLM de-biasing as a deliberate, value-laden enterprise, tied to broader goals of social amelioration and conceptual reform

In model news: OpenAI releases a new model, GPT-4.1 for API use only. The model boasts a 1 million token context length, impressive SWE-bench scores, and some concerning misalignment potential! OpenAI also released o3 and o4-mini with fanfare on o3’s HLE score and improved performance on long duration tasks. OpenAI also announced plans for its first open model since GPT-2, and released native image generation (all those Ghiblis) in ChatGPT (very good for making graphics for slides). Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro launched to an almost-unprecedented lead of 40+ points on LM Arena, with Google models dominating the Pareto frontier, while Meta’s Llama 4 underwhelmed. Meanwhile, Nova Act from Amazon offers 3-line browser automation and Google offers a new Agent2Agent (A2A) open protocol for agent communication.

For research: Sakana’s AI Scientist v2 performs agentic tree search to accelerate scientific discovery (or at least writing of accepted papers at AI workshops). Speaking of agents, four LMs were given computers and the goal of collaboratively choosing a charity and raising as much money as possible for them. In other research news, AlphaXiv enables Elicit or Undermind style research assistance to help generate literature reviews on the basis of ArXiv papers. Goodfire also released the first open-source sparse autoencoder so that you can dig into models on your own! In hardware news: Nvidia’s GR00T N1 advertises the “age of generalist robotics” with System 1/System 2 architectures for humanoid cognition. At the frontier: 1X’s Neo is in-home and reports from China tout industry-scale progress.

On the safety and policy front: Stanford’s comprehensive 2025 AI Index reports on a staggering array of AI-relevant developments. The Frontier Model Forum formalized inter-firm threat sharing, and Jonathan Stray proposed “maximum equal approval” as a metric for political neutrality in AI. A LessWrong study reexamines alignment faking with improved classifiers (AUROC 0.92), and Anthropic releases new research to the effect that Reasoning Models Don’t Always Say What They Think. Other research from Anthropic makes sociotechnical evaluation in education settings easier. Dworkesh Patel’s Scaling Era looks back at the recent history of the people involved in AI, and Vintage Data and AI-2027 look ahead and try to make research-based predictions about AGI.

Elsewhere: the Wall Street Journal looks into Sam Altman’s firing and rapid reinstatement, Meta goes to anti-trust court, and Google receives another inditement for anti-competitive practices.

Need a better grip on the fundamentals? Check out Sander Dielman’s explanation of the modeling pipeline. It’s not quite an entry level piece, but one which, if you work through it, will give you a better than average understanding of how models turn text and images into vectors, and then convert that into something useful!
