Normative Philosophy of Computing - January
JAN 16, 2025

Happy New Year!

The wrap up to 2024 brought a number of big leaps forward in both open and closed AI models, with o3 and DeepSeek’s V3 likely the pick of the bunch. And 2025 is off to a fast start with an ambitious new AI policy plan from the UK (with a prominent role for the AI Safety Institute), as well as strict new rules on the diffusion of AI related tech from the US government, and some early hints of what’s ahead for AI policy in the Trump administration.

The new year brings an exciting new collaboration to share research in philosophy of AI, be sure to sign up to the Philosophy of AI Network Talks series for updates (https://sites.google.com/view/paint-series/home). Also look out for some cool CFPs below.

And as always, feel free to share this newsletter with anyone who might benefit—especially PhD students and researchers just getting started in normative philosophy of computing. And do send us anything you’d like shared with the community (email mint@anu.edu.au)

AI Model Breakthroughs and Insights

OpenAI’s new o3 model may mark a paradigm shift in AI, with Amjad Masad speculating its roots in AlphaZero-style techniques (though Nathan Lambert’s take is that explicit search isn’t involved). Meanwhile, “unfaithful chain-of-thought” research uncovers hidden reasoning in models, as explored by Arthur Conmy. A blog post dives into o3’s performance on advanced math tasks, offering critical insights into AI’s evolving capabilities. NVIDIA announces a new Nemotron model family for agentic AI. And Sam Altman turns in earnest toward super-intelligence as a goal as Anthropic releases new recommendations for practical directions in contemporary safety work. Sakana AI announces new generation of “adaptive models” which adapt model weights and architecture depending on the tasks they’re given—more here on Transformer^2.

Tools, Platforms, and Development

Discover Genesis, a generative robotics platform for embodied AI learning, now on GitHub. AI agents managing GPUs? Jasper introduces the groundbreaking AgentKit. On Hugging Face, explore DeepSeek-V3-Base, a mixture-of-experts model pushing boundaries in open-source AI. Finally, check out Anthropic’s guide to effective AI agents, packed with workflows and tips, here.

Broader Reflections and News on AI

A new AI Snake Oil essay by Arvind Narayanan investigates the shifting narrative around scaling and its implications. Kate Crawford’s Wired piece, “Manipulation Engines,” examines the risks of AI-driven personal assistants—read it here. Jim Fan’s perspective reveals how simulation environments prepare AI for real-world complexities, illustrating the promise and challenges of advanced training. Chris Potts gives a talk on LLM use for close linguistic analysis. Models at Johns Hopkins imagine in-depth scenarios based on single images.

In news at Meta we hear that they have started to ship AI generated profiles. This comes as they also replace fact-checking with Community Notes. For discussion of the political dimensions of this work, see Laura Edelson’s commentary.

In separate news, Anton Leicht writes about the Politics of Inference Scaling and MIT Economist Daren Acemoglu examines what it would take to remake America’s tech sector. Huggingface policy researcher Avijit Ghosh talks AI agents. Pliny the Liberator explores darker risks attached to AI agents, should they ever gain access to funds.

The UK public is “worried” and ‘scared’ about the future of AI while the Labour Party announces a massive rollout of public data. Hayden Belfield writes up the 50 recommendations in the UK’s AI Action Plan and the US announces a tiered AI chip distribution plan. US model weights are also now subject to export controls when they go above a certain limit (10^26 operations)—read commentary here. Rand Corp. Lennart Heim discusses this by approaching the question, “Can export controls create a U.S.-led global artificial intelligence ecosystem?”

Papers

Who Does the Giant Number Pile Like Best: Analyzing Fairness in Hiring Contexts

Authors: Preethi Seshadri, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant | arXiv Preprint

Explores fairness in LLM-based hiring systems through resume summarization and retrieval tasks using a synthetic dataset. The study reveals race-based differences in 10% of summaries and gender-based differences in 1%, with retrieval models exhibiting non-uniform selection patterns and high sensitivity to demographic and non-demographic changes. Highlights concerns about bias and brittleness in LLMs used for high-stakes hiring applications.

Desire-Fulfilment and Consciousness

Author: Andreas Mogensen (Global Priorities Institute, University of Oxford) | GPI Working Paper No. 24-2024

Argues that individuals without the capacity for consciousness can still accrue welfare goods under a nuanced understanding of desire-fulfilment theory. Mogensen critiques earlier, oversimplified approaches to the theory, offering a refined perspective that avoids counter-intuitive implications while aligning with contemporary developments.

Imperfect Recall and AI Delegation

Authors: Eric Olav Chen, Alexis Ghersengorin (Global Priorities Institute, University of Oxford), and Sami Petersen (Department of Economics, University of Oxford) | GPI Working Paper No. 30-2024

Explores how a principal can use imperfect recall to test and discipline potentially misaligned AI systems. By simulating tasks in testing environments and obscuring whether tasks are real or tests, the principal can screen and influence AI behavior effectively, even without the ability to commit to a testing mechanism or restrict AI actions. The paper demonstrates that increasing tests enhances control, making imperfect recall critical for successful AI delegation.

A Theory of Appropriateness with Applications to Generative Artificial Intelligence

Authors: Joel Z. Leibo, Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, Manfred Diaz, John P. Agapiou, William A. Cunningham, Peter Sunehag, Julia Haas, Raphael Koster, Edgar A. Duéñez-Guzmán, William S. Isaac, Georgios Piliouras, Stanley M. Bileschi, Iyad Rahwan, Simon Osindero | arXiv Preprint

Explores the concept of appropriateness in human and AI contexts, offering a theory to guide responsible deployment of generative AI based on societal and cognitive underpinnings of appropriateness judgments.

How to Tell if a Rule Was Broken: The Role of Codification, Norms, Morality, and Legitimacy

Authors: Jordan Wylie, Dries H. Bostyn, Ana P. Gantman | OSF Preprint

Investigates how various signals, including codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy, influence judgments about whether a rule was violated, highlighting the interplay between legal codification and societal norms in rule concept formation.
