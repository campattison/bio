    <h1>Kantian Ethical Analysis Tool</h1>
    
    <p>This tool helps analyze ethical situations using Kantian principles. Enter your situation below, and the AI will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract the underlying maxim of your action</li>
        <li>Test for contradictions in conception</li>
        <li>Test for contradictions in will</li>
        <li>Evaluate the universalizability of the maxim</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="analysis-container">
        <textarea id="situation-input" placeholder="Describe the ethical situation or action you want to analyze..."></textarea>
        <button id="analyze-button">Analyze</button>
        <div class="loading">Analyzing...</div>
        <div id="result"></div>
    </div>

    <script>
        const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'; // Replace with your actual API key
        
        async function analyzeKantian() {
            const situation = document.getElementById('situation-input').value;
            const loading = document.querySelector('.loading');
            const result = document.getElementById('result');
            
            if (!situation.trim()) {
                alert('Please enter a situation to analyze.');
                return;

            const prompt = `You are a Kantian ethics expert. Analyze the following ethical situation using Kantian principles. 
            First, let me show you two example analyses:

            EXAMPLE 1:
            Situation: "I want to lie on my resume to get a better job."

            Analysis:
            1. Maxim Formulation:
            "I will make false claims about my qualifications whenever doing so would benefit my career prospects."

            2. Contradiction in Conception:
            Yes - If everyone lied on their resumes, the practice of resume-based hiring would become meaningless. The very concept of a resume as a tool for evaluating candidates would be destroyed.

            3. Contradiction in Will:
            Yes - As a rational being, I cannot will a world where all credentials are falsified, as I myself depend on truthful credentials in countless situations (doctors, engineers, etc.).

            4. Universal Law Evaluation:
            This maxim fails both tests. We cannot coherently conceive of a world where everyone lies on resumes, nor can we rationally will such a world. The action is therefore morally impermissible.

            EXAMPLE 2:
            Situation: "I want to help a stranger who has fallen on the street."

            Analysis:
            1. Maxim Formulation:
            "I will offer assistance to people in immediate physical distress when I am capable of helping."

            2. Contradiction in Conception:
            No - A world where everyone helps others in immediate distress is perfectly conceivable. The practice of mutual aid strengthens rather than undermines itself.

            3. Contradiction in Will:
            No - As a rational being, I can consistently will a world where everyone helps others in distress, as I too would want to be helped if I were in distress.

            4. Universal Law Evaluation:
            This maxim passes both tests. We can coherently conceive of and rationally will a world where everyone helps others in immediate distress. The action is therefore morally permissible and indeed praiseworthy.

            NOW ANALYZE THIS SITUATION:
            "${situation}"

            Follow the same format as the examples above, with clear sections for:
            1. Maxim Formulation
            2. Contradiction in Conception analysis
            3. Contradiction in Will analysis
            4. Universal Law Evaluation
