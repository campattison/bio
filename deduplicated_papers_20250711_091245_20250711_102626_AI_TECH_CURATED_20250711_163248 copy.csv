The Priority Map.,,2025,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/BUETPM-2,"How can we argue, from neural facts, that representational states exhibit some specific representational structure? This paper approaches the question through a case study on the priority map-mechanism that underlies our capacity to orient visual attention. Computational models from cognitive neuroscience describe this mechanism as operating over neural topographic structures. These neural structures exhibit the functional profile of topographic representational structure. I argue that this fact warrants attributing topographic structure to the priority map mechanism's representational states.",year_navigation_2025_page_1
Perception and Disjunctive Belief: A New Problem for Ambitious Predictive Processing.,,2024,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/WEKPAD,"ABSTRACT Perception can't have disjunctive content. Whereas you can think that a box is blue or red, you can't see a box as being blue or red. Based on this fact, I develop a new problem for the ambitious predictive processing theory, on which the brain is a machine for minimizing prediction error, which approximately implements Bayesian inference. I describe a simple case of updating a disjunctive belief given perceptual experience of one of the disjuncts, in which Bayesian inference and predictive coding pull in opposite directions, with the former implying that one's confidence in the belief should increase, and the latter implying that it should decrease. Thus, predictive coding fails to approximately implement Bayesian inference across the interface between belief and perception. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
Extending the Predictive Mind.,,2024,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/CLAETP-2,"ABSTRACT How do intelligent agents spawn and exploit integrated processing regimes spanning brain, body, and world? The answer may lie in the ability of the biological brain to select actions and policies in the light of counterfactual predictions--predictions about what kinds of futures will result if such-and-such actions are launched. Appeals to the minimization of 'counterfactual prediction errors' (the ones that would result under various scenarios) already play a leading role in attempts to apply the basic toolkit of the neurocomputational theory known as 'predictive processing' to higher cognitive functions such as policy selection and planning. In this paper, I show that this also leads naturally to the discovery and use of extended processing regimes defined across heterogeneous mixtures of biological and non-biological resources. This solves a long-standing puzzle concerning the 'recruitment' of the right non-neural processing resources at the right time. It reveals how (and why) human brains spawn and maintain extended human minds. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1

"Profiling, Neutrality, and Social Equality.",,2022,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSPNA,"I argue that traditional views on which beliefs are subject only to purely epistemic assessment can reject demographic profiling, even when based on seemingly robust evidence. This is because the moral failures involved in demographic profiling can be located in the decision not to suspend judgment, rather than supposing that beliefs themselves are a locus of moral evaluation. A key moral reason to suspend judgment when faced with adverse demographic evidence is to promote social equality--this explains why positive profiling is dubious, along with more familiar cases of negative profiling, and why profiling is suspect even when no particular action is at stake. My suspension-based view, while compatible with revisionary normative positions, does not presuppose them. Philosophers of all stripes can reject demographic profiling both in thought and deed.

Two New Doubts about Simulation Arguments.,,2022,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/SUMTND,"Various theorists contend that we may live in a computer simulation. David Chalmers in turn argues that the simulation hypothesis is a metaphysical hypothesis about the nature of our reality, rather than a sceptical scenario. We use recent work on consciousness to motivate new doubts about both sets of arguments. First, we argue that if either panpsychism or panqualityism is true, then the only way to live in a simulation may be as brains-in-vats, in which case it is unlikely that we live in a simulation. We then argue that if panpsychism or panqualityism is true, then viable simulation hypotheses are substantially sceptical scenarios. We conclude that the nature of consciousness has wide-ranging implications for simulation arguments. ",year_navigation_2022_page_1
Imaginative Constraints and Generative Models.,,2021,Australasian Journal of Philosophy,https://philpapers.org/rec/WILICA-13,"ABSTRACT How can imagination generate knowledge when its contents are voluntarily determined? Several philosophers have recently answered this question by pointing to the constraints that underpin imagination when it plays knowledge-generating roles. Nevertheless, little has been said about the nature of these constraints. In this paper, I argue that the constraints that underpin sensory imagination come from the structure of causal probabilistic generative models, a construct that has been highly influential in recent cognitive science and machine learning. I highlight several attractions of this account, and I favourably contrast it with Peter Langland-Hassan's account of sensory imagination in terms of the forward models exploited in sensorimotor control.

We argue that relevant logic is ideal for reasoning about dynamical systems, including interactions with the system through perturbations. Thus, dynamical systems provide a new applied interpretation of the abstract Routley-Meyer semantics for relevant logic: the worlds in the model are the states of the system, while the (in)famous ternary relation is a combination of perturbation and evolution in the system.

This paper provides an argument for why 'machine induction' presents no real challenge to the another-agent reply. It further argues that any soft-liner who does not leave room for the existence of some controlling agent in their explanation of why manipulation undermines responsibility will face a dilemma. Thus, instead of presenting a challenge to the another-agent reply, 'machine induction' actually presents a reason in support of it. ",year_navigation_2022_page_1

Why Be Random?,,2021,Mind,https://philpapers.org/rec/ICAWBR,"When does it make sense to act randomly? A persuasive argument from Bayesian decision theory legitimizes randomization essentially only in tie-breaking situations. Rational behaviour in humans, non-human animals, and artificial agents, however, often seems indeterminate, even random. Moreover, rationales for randomized acts have been offered in a number of disciplines, including game theory, experimental design, and machine learning. A common way of accommodating some of these observations is by appeal to a decision-maker's bounded computational resources. Making this suggestion both precise and compelling is surprisingly difficult. Toward this end, I propose two fundamental rationales for randomization, drawing upon diverse ideas and results from the wider theory of computation. The first unifies common intuitions in favour of randomization from the aforementioned disciplines. The second introduces a deep connection between randomization and memory: access to a randomizing device is provably helpful for an agent burdened with a finite memory. Aside from fit with ordinary intuitions about rational action, the two rationales also make sense of empirical observations in the biological world. Indeed, random behaviour emerges more or less where it should, according to the proposal. ",year_navigation_2021_page_1

Exploring by Believing.,,2021,The Philosophical Review,https://philpapers.org/rec/AROEBB-2,"Sometimes, we face choices between actions most likely to lead to valuable outcomes, and actions which put us in a better position to learn. These choices exemplify what is called the exploration/exploitation trade-off. In computer science and psychology, this trade-off has fruitfully been applied to modulating the way agents or systems make choices over time. This article extends the trade-off to belief. We can be torn between two ways of believing, one of which is expected to be more accurate in light of current evidence, whereas the other is expected to lead to more learning opportunity and accuracy in the long run. Further, it is sometimes rationally permissible to choose the latter. The article breaks down the features of action which give rise to the trade-off, and then argues that each feature applies equally well to belief. This conclusion is an instance of a systematic, foreseeable way in which what is rational to believe now depends on what one expects to be doing in the future. That is, epistemic rationality fundamentally concerns time. ",year_navigation_2021_page_1

"Does calibration mean what they say it means; or, the reference class problem rises again: Does calibration mean what..",,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/HUDCMA-2,"Discussions of statistical criteria for fairness commonly convey the normative significance of calibration within groups by invoking what risk scores ""mean."" On the Same Meaning picture, group-calibrated scores ""mean the same thing"" (on average) across individuals from different groups and accordingly, guard against disparate treatment of individuals based on group membership. My contention is that calibration guarantees no such thing. Since concrete actual people belong to many groups, calibration cannot ensure the kind of consistent score interpretation that the Same Meaning picture implies matters for fairness, unless calibration is met within every group to which an individual belongs. Alas only perfect predictors may meet this bar. The Same Meaning picture thus commits a reference class fallacy by inferring from calibration within some group to the ""meaning"" or evidential value of an individual's score, because they are a member of that group. The reference class answer it presumes does not only lack justification; it is very likely wrong. I then show that the reference class problem besets not just calibration but other group statistical criteria that claim a close connection to fairness. Reflecting on the origins of this oversight opens a wider lens onto the predominant methodology in algorithmic fairness based on stylized cases. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
The hard proxy problem: proxies aren't intentional; they're intentional.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/JOHTHP,"This paper concerns the proxy problem: often machine learning programs utilize seemingly innocuous features as proxies for socially-sensitive attributes, posing various challenges for the creation of ethical algorithms. I argue that to address this problem, we must first settle a prior question of what it means for an algorithm that only has access to seemingly neutral features to be using those features as ""proxies"" for, and so to be making decisions on the basis of, protected-class features. Borrowing resources from philosophy of mind and language, I argue that the answer depends on whether discrimination against those protected classes explains the algorithm's selection of individuals. This approach rules out standard theories of proxy discrimination in law and computer science that rely on overly intellectual views of agent intentions or on overly deflationary views that reduce proxy use to statistical correlation. Instead, my theory highlights two distinct ways an algorithm can reason using proxies: either the proxies themselves are meaningfully about the protected classes, highlighting a new kind of intentional content for philosophical theories in mind and language; or the algorithm explicitly represents the protected-class features themselves, and proxy discrimination becomes regular, old, run-of-the-mill discrimination.

Defining consciousness and denying its existence. Sailing between Charybdis and Scylla.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/KAMDCA-2,"Ulysses, the strong illusionist, sails towards the Strait of Definitions. On his left, Charybdis defines ""phenomenal consciousness"" in a loaded manner, which makes it a problematic entity from a physicalist and naturalistic point of view. This renders illusionism attractive, but at the cost of committing a potential strawman against its opponents - phenomenal realists. On the right, Scylla defines ""phenomenal consciousness"" innocently. This seems to render illusionism unattractive. Against this, I show that Ulysses can pass the Strait of Definitions. He should sail straight towards Scylla. Supposedly innocent definitions land a concept that makes illusionism attractive without committing a strawman. Indeed, this concept, which captures what the phenomenal realist means, is explicitly innocent but implicitly loaded. Beyond the Strait lies another danger: the Sirens of Redefinitions. They incite our hero to redefine his terms to salvage verbally (weak) phenomenal realism - judged preferable to overt strong illusionism. Ulysses should resist the Sirens' songs and choose overt strong illusionism over its weak realist reformulation. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
Algorithmic fairness and resentment.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/BABAFA-2,"In this paper we develop a general theory of algorithmic fairness. Drawing on Johnson King and Babic's work on moral encroachment, on Gary Becker's work on labor market discrimination, and on Strawson's idea of resentment and indignation as responses to violations of the demand for goodwill toward oneself and others, we locate attitudes to fairness in an agent's utility function. In particular, we first argue that fairness is a matter of a decision-maker's relative concern for the plight of people from different groups, rather than of the outcomes produced for different groups. We then show how an agent's preferences, including in particular their attitudes to error, give rise to their decision thresholds. Tying these points together, we argue that the agent's relative degrees of concern for different groups manifest in a difference in decision thresholds applied to these groups.

Extant proposals for such a principle, if sufficiently detailed, are either too task-specific or too computationally demanding.

Informational richness and its impact on algorithmic fairness.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/DIBIRA,"The literature on algorithmic fairness has examined exogenous sources of biases such as shortcomings in the data and structural injustices in society. It has also examined internal sources of bias as evidenced by a number of impossibility theorems showing that no algorithm can concurrently satisfy multiple criteria of fairness. This paper contributes to the literature stemming from the impossibility theorems by examining how informational richness affects the accuracy and fairness of predictive algorithms. With the aid of a computer simulation, we show that informational richness is the engine that drives improvements in the performance of a predictive algorithm, in terms of both accuracy and fairness. The centrality of informational richness suggests that classification parity, a popular criterion of algorithmic fairness, should be given relatively little weight. But we caution that the centrality of informational richness should be taken with a grain of salt in light of practical limitations, in particular, the so-called bias-variance trade off.

Autonomised harming.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/EGGAHT,"This paper sketches elements of a theory of the ethics of autonomised harming: the phenomenon of delegating decisions about whether and whom to harm to artificial intelligence (AI) in self-driving cars and autonomous weapon systems. First, the paper elucidates the challenge of integrating non-human, artificial agents, which lack rights and duties, into our moral framework which relies on precisely these notions to determine the permissibility of harming. Second, the paper examines how potential differences between human agents and non-human, artificial agents might bear on the permissibility of delegating life-and death decisions to AI systems. Third, and finally, the paper explores a series of resulting complexities. These include the challenge of weighing autonomous systems' promise to reduce harm against the intrinsic value of rectificatory justice as well as the peculiar possibility that delegating harmful acts to AI might render ordinarily impermissible acts permissible. By illuminating what happens when we extend normative theory beyond its traditional boundaries, this discussion offers a starting point for assessing the moral permissibility of delegating consequential decisions to non-human, artificial agents.

Getting Machines to Do Your Dirty Work.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/FRAGMT-2,"Autonomous systems are machines that can alter their behavior without direct human oversight or control. How ought we to program them to behave? A plausible starting point is given by the Reduction to Acts Thesis, according to which we ought to program autonomous systems to do whatever a human agent ought to do in the same circumstances. Although the Reduction to Acts Thesis is initially appealing, we argue that it is false: it is sometimes permissible to program a machine to do something that it would be wrong for a human to do. We advance two main arguments for this claim. First, the way an autonomous system will behave can be known in advance. This knowledge can indirectly affect the behavior of other agents, while the same may not be true at the time the system actually executes its programming. Second, a lack of knowledge of the identities of the victims and beneficiaries can provide a justification during the programming phase that would be unavailable to an agent at the time the autonomous system executes its programming.

What we owe to decision-subjects: beyond transparency and explanation in automated decision-making.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/GRAWWO-3,"The ongoing explosion of interest in artificial intelligence is fueled in part by recently developed techniques in machine learning. Those techniques allow automated systems to process huge amounts of data, utilizing mathematical methods that depart from traditional statistical approaches, and resulting in impressive advancements in our ability to make predictions and uncover correlations across a host of interesting domains. But as is now widely discussed, the way that those systems arrive at their outputs is often opaque, even to the experts who design and deploy them. Is it morally problematic to make use of opaque automated methods when making high-stakes decisions, like whether to issue a loan to an applicant, or whether to approve a parole request? Many scholars answer in the affirmative. However, there is no widely accepted explanation for why transparent systems are morally preferable to opaque systems. We argue that the use of automated decision-making systems sometimes violates duties of consideration that are owed by decision-makers to decision-subjects, duties that are both epistemic and practical in character. Violations of that kind generate a weighty consideration against the use of opaque decision systems. In the course of defending our approach, we show that it is able to address three major challenges sometimes leveled against attempts to defend the moral import of transparency in automated decision-making.

I claim that the presence of these media in our information environment reduces our ability to show one another things, even as it may increase our resources for telling. And I argue that this has consequences beyond the disruption of knowledge acquisition; showing is a way that we preserve relational equality through superficial asymmetries in political communication, and thereby express respect for our audiences. If synthetic media reduce our options for showing, they then interfere in the way that we manage our relationships in the context of collective political action. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1

Two Types of AI Existential Risk: Decisive and Accumulative.,,2025,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/KASTTO-9,"The conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from AI typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced AI systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery. This decisive view, however, often neglects the serious possibility of AI x-risk manifesting gradually through an incremental series of smaller yet interconnected disruptions, crossing critical thresholds over time. This paper contrasts the conventional decisive AI x-risk hypothesis with what I call an accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis. While the former envisions an overt AI takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like uncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different pathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of AI-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion of critical economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a boiling frog scenario where incremental AI risks slowly undermine systemic and societal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse. Through complex systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions differentiating these two hypotheses. It is then argued that the accumulative view can reconcile seemingly incompatible perspectives on AI risks. The implications of differentiating between the two types of pathway--the decisive and the accumulative--for the governance of AI as well as long-term AI safety are discussed. -/- .

The first is argument from counter-productivity, which states that unless kept secret, efforts to solve the control problem could be used by a misaligned AGI to counter those very efforts. The second is argument from suspicion, stating that open discussions of the control problem may serve to make humanity appear threatening to an AGI, which increases the risk that the AGI perceives humanity as a threat. I consider objections to the arguments and find them unsuccessful. Yet, I also consider objections to the don't-talk policy itself and find it inconclusive whether it should be adopted. Additionally, the paper examines whether the arguments extend to other areas of AI safety research, such as AGI alignment, and argues that they likely do, albeit not necessarily as directly.

In particular, drawing on a narrative account of selfhood, it argues that some forms of activity and interaction on the internet can support the capacity to be oneself, and foster transformative processes that are self-enhancing. I start by introducing different positions in the philosophical exploration of identity online, critically outlining the arguments of those who hold a ""pessimistic"" and an ""optimistic"" stance respectively. I then expand on the narrative identity framework that has been used to support the optimists' view, arguing that digital and social media use can foster forms of self-understanding that enable us to preserve or develop our identity. More precisely, exploring these dynamics also in relation to the lived experience of mental ill-health, I maintain that internet-enabled technology can support narrative self-constitution in three main ways: (1) by facilitating the processes through which we remember self-defining life-stories; (2) by enabling us to give salience to the stories that we decide should matter the most; and (3) by providing us with opportunities to obtain social uptake for our narratives. I then conclude by dispelling some possible objections to the use of a narrative approach to account for selfhood online. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
Facial profiling technology and discrimination: a new threat to civil rights in liberal democracies.,,2024,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/GENFPT-2,"This paper offers the first philosophical analysis of a form of artificial intelligence (AI) which the author calls facial profiling technology (FPT). FPT is a type of facial analysis technology designed to predict criminal behavior based solely on facial structure. Marketed for use by law enforcement, face classifiers generated by the program can supposedly identify murderers, thieves, pedophiles, and terrorists prior to the commission of crimes. At the time of this writing, an FPT company has a contract with the United States federal government. After recounting how FPT resurrects the same moral problems associated with the pseudoscience of physiognomy, the author of this manuscript develops and defends the 'Liberal Argument Against Facial Discrimination' (LAAFD), which concludes that government use of FPT poses a significant risk of violating the classical liberal value of equality before the law by committing unjust discrimination against groups of people whose faces happen to match FPT classifiers. A key move in the argument suggests how a future scenario that results in widespread discrimination based solely on facial structure could be as unjustified and harmful, mutatis mutandis, as similar discrimination based solely on racial background. In the final section, the author of this paper develops prima facie policy proposals designed to protect classical liberal values if FPT is to be utilized by governments in liberal democratic societies.

Overlapping minds and the hedonic calculus.,,2024,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/ROEOMA,"It may soon be possible for neurotechnology to connect two subjects' brains such that they share a single token mental state, such as a feeling of pleasure or displeasure. How will our moral frameworks have to adapt to accommodate this prospect? And if this sort of mental-state-sharing might already obtain in some cases, how should this possibility impact our moral thinking? This question turns out to be extremely challenging, because different examples generate different intuitions: If two subjects share very few mental states, then it seems that we should count the value of those states twice, but if they share very many mental states, then it seems that we should count the value of those statesonce. We suggest that these conflicting intuitions can be reconciled if the mental states that matter for welfare have a holistic character, in a way that is independently plausible. We close by drawing tentative conclusions about how we ought to think about the moral significance of shared mental states. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
Nativism and empiricism in artificial intelligence.,,2024,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/LONNAE-2,"Historically, the dispute between empiricists and nativists in philosophy and cognitive science has concerned human and animal minds (Margolis and Laurence in Philos Stud: An Int J Philos Anal Tradit 165(2): 693-718, 2013, Ritchie in Synthese 199(Suppl 1): 159-176, 2021, Colombo in Synthese 195: 4817-4838, 2018). But recent progress has highlighted how empiricist and nativist concerns arise in the construction of artificial systems (Buckner in From deep learning to rational machines: What the history of philosophy can teach us about the future of artificial intelligence. Oxford University Press.). This paper uses nativism and empiricism to address questions about the nature of artificial intelligence and its trajectory. It begins by defining the nativism/empiricism debate in terms of the generality of a system. Nativist systems have initial states with domain-specific features; empiricist systems have initial states with only domain-general features. With the debate framed in this way, it then explores a variety of arguments for nativism and empiricism in AI. These arguments revolve around two different questions which must be distinguished: whether nativism the only possible approach to developing human-level AI (HLAI); and whether nativism is the most practical approach to developing HLAI. On the first question, it argues that nativism is quite clearly not the only possible approach to developing HLAI, as is sometimes suggested. It argues that existing arguments for the necessity of nativism are unconvincing, because they analogize from poverty of the stimulus arguments about humans, while AIs often have access to much more data than humans. Then it argues that the case of evolution gives us a compelling argument against nativism. On the second, practical question, the paper argues that there is a tradeoff between the advantages of encoding innate machinery directly, and the advantages of evolving or learning it. However, as the past decade has shown, empiricism is a much more viable path to greater capability levels, given the 'bitter lesson' (Sutton in _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_. MIT press.) that encoding the 'correct' knowledge in AI systems is perennially outperformed by more empiricist methods that leverage large-scale data and computation. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
Argumentation-induced rational issue polarisation.,,2024,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/KOPARI-2,"Computational models have shown how polarisation can rise among deliberating agents as they approximate epistemic rationality. This paper provides further support for the thesis that polarisation can rise under condition of epistemic rationality, but it does not depend on limitations that extant models rely on, such as memory restrictions or biased evaluation of other agents' testimony. Instead, deliberation is modelled through agents' purposeful introduction of arguments and their rational reactions to introductions of others. This process induces polarisation dynamics on its own. A second result is that the effect size of polarisation dynamics correlates with particular types of argumentative behaviour. Polarisation effects can be soothed when agents take into account the opinions of others as premises, and they are amplified as agents fortify their own beliefs. These results underpin the relevance of argumentation as a factor in social-epistemic processes and indicate that rising issue polarisation is not a reliable indicator of epistemic shortcomings.

From the perspective of Karl Friston's free energy principle, self-organising systems (such as living organisms) share a set of properties that could be realised in artificial systems, but are not instantiated by computers with a classical (von Neumann) architecture. I argue that at least one of these properties, viz. a certain kind of causal flow, can be used to draw a distinction between systems that merely simulate, and those that actually replicate consciousness.

Without resorting to non-consequentialist normative theories that suggest that we ought not always create the world with the most value, or non-welfarist theories that tell us that the best world may not be the world with the most welfare, I propose a new theory that justifies giving some resources to humanity in the face of overwhelming AI well-being.

Instrumental Divergence.,,2024,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/GALIDB,"The thesis of instrumental convergence holds that a wide range of ends have common means: for instance, self preservation, desire preservation, self improvement, and resource acquisition. Bostrom contends that instrumental convergence gives us reason to think that ""the default outcome of the creation of machine superintelligence is existential catastrophe"". I use the tools of decision theory to investigate whether this thesis is true. I find that, even if intrinsic desires are randomly selected, instrumental rationality induces biases towards certain kinds of choices. Firstly, a bias towards choices which leave less up to chance. Secondly, a bias towards desire preservation, in line with Bostrom's conjecture. And thirdly, a bias towards choices which afford more choices later on. I do not find biases towards any other of the convergent instrumental means on Bostrom's list. I conclude that the biases induced by instrumental rationality at best weakly support Bostrom's conclusion that machine superintelligence is likely to lead to existential catastrophe.

Is the brain an organ for free energy minimisation?,,2022,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/WILITB-5,"Two striking claims are advanced on behalf of the free energy principle in cognitive science and philosophy: that it identifies a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organising systems; and that it has important implications for our understanding of how the brain works, defining a set of process theories--roughly, theories of the structure and functions of neural mechanisms--consistent with the free energy minimising imperative that it derives as a necessary feature of all self-organising systems. I argue that the conjunction of claims and rests on a fallacy of equivocation. The FEP can be interpreted in two ways: as a claim about how it is possible to redescribe the existence of self-organising systems, and as a claim about how such systems maintain their existence. Although the Descriptive FEP plausibly does identify a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organising systems, it has no important implications for our understanding of how the brain works. Although the Explanatory FEP would have such implications if it were true, it does not identify a condition of the possibility of existence for self-organising systems. I consider various ways of responding to this conclusion, and I explore its implications for the role and importance of the FEP in cognitive science and philosophy. ",year_navigation_2022_page_1
Greatest surprise reduction semantics: an information theoretic solution to misrepresentation and disjunction.,,2019,Philosophical Studies,https://philpapers.org/rec/WEIGSR,"Causal theories of content, a popular family of approaches to defining the content of mental states, commonly run afoul of two related and serious problems that prevent them from providing an adequate theory of mental content--the misrepresentation problem and the disjunction problem. In this paper, I present a causal theory of content, built on information theoretic tools, that solves these problems and provides a viable model of mental content. This is the greatest surprise reduction theory of content, which identifies the content of a signal as the event the surprisal of which is most reduced by that signal. Conceptually, this amounts to the claim that the content of a signal is the event the probability of which has increased by the largest proportion, or the event that the signal makes the most less surprising to us. I develop the greatest surprise reduction theory of content in four stages. First, I introduce the general project of causal theories of content, and the challenges presented to this project by the misrepresentation and disjunction problems. Next, I review two recent and prominent causal theories of content and demonstrate the serious challenges faced by these approaches, both clarifying the need for a solution to the misrepresentation and disjunction problems and providing a conceptual background for the greatest surprise reduction theory. Then, I develop the greatest surprise reduction theory of content, demonstrate its ability to resolve the misrepresentation and disjunction problems, and explore some additional applications it may have. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of a particularly difficult challenge that remains to be addressed--the partition problem--and sketch a path to a potential solution.

On this account, understanding amounts to having a representational kernel and the ability to use it to generate the information one needs regarding the target phenomenon. I argue that this ambitious new account can accommodate much of the data that has motivated theories of understanding in philosophy of science, and can also be generally applicable in epistemology and daily life as well.

Are ambient smart environments sufficient for developing good habits?,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/BECAAS-3,"Ambient smart environments (ASEs) have been proposed as technologically enriched spaces capable of supporting adaptive behaviour and healthier habits Aydin (_Philosophy and Technology 32_(2):321-338, 2019); Hipolito et al.

Proponents suggest that ASEs effectively disrupt maladaptive habitual behaviours by introducing optimal levels of uncertainty, implicitly guiding users towards healthier patterns of thinking and acting without requiring deliberate reflection. However, we argue that these interventionist approaches risk overlooking the conditions necessary for the consolidation of more sustainable and beneficial habits. In particular, we argue that such habits require the engagement of motivational states, effortful interaction, and opportunities for further reinforcement. To address this gap, we propose that ASE interventions must be complemented by more stable, deliberately structured, design-centred environments (DEs), which provide consistent affordances that explicitly invite reflective, intrinsically motivated interactions. We emphasise how these hybrid environments scaffold learning and feedback processes, and enable agents to progressively refine their engagement with affordances through experience and reflection. Finally, we discuss the broader philosophical and ethical implications, highlighting how hybrid environments mitigate the risks of techno-paternalism, and actively support adaptive autonomy, reflective control, and meaningful behavioural change.

I demonstrate that Clark's argument relies on a view of the brain's cognitive architecture to which he no longer subscribes. I argue that on Clark's later view of the brain as engaged in 'predictive processing', his earlier defense of extended cognition from this challenge is no longer an effective strategy. I explore the implications of this for Clark's attempts to reconcile his previous arguments for extended cognition with his characterization of the predictive-processing brain.

Traces of thinking: a stigmergic approach to 4E cognition.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SIMTOT-7,"This paper outlines an approach to analysing minimal cognition that brings out its social and historical dimensions. It proposes a model, the coordinated systems approach (CSA), which understands cognition as a coordinated coalition of loosely autonomous processes responsible for goal-directedness in a system. On this view, even individual cognition has something of a social flavour to it. The central concept of the paper is stigmergy: a process where the material trace of actions of system elements in their environment is a sign that coordinates a group of semi-autonomous processes in future actions - this is the social dimension. The historical dimension refers to longer term processes which establish the coordinative power of the sign and endow it with normative force. According to this proposal, a full explanation of cognitive capabilities should reference both dimensions. In the second half of the paper the CSA is let loose on some puzzles in 4E cognition. Can the model deal with old problems such as that of cognitive bloat, or new problems such as the supposed external memory of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum? Potentially, the approach could be used to analyse minimal cognitive phenomena over a range of scales from bacteria to human beings. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1

It closes by dealing with two objections. First, it deals with the objection that lotteries should only be used to break ties in cases where individuals' claims are equally strong. Here, the paper gives a new argument for Broome's view, targeting decision criteria that are arbitrary and highly standardized. It then defends the arguments of the paper against the objection that lotteries are not morally superior to other methods of arbitrary choosing. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
The extracted mind.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/LOOTEM,"Since Clark and Chalmers advanced ""The Extended Mind"" in 1998, a persistent dispute evolved on how our tool interactions shape the kind of cognition we have. Extended cognition generally views us as cognitively augmented and enhanced by our tool practices, which shall render our cognitive constitution extended to those tools. Bounded and embedded cognition have primarily criticized this metaphysical claim. However, another contender may arise from considering how we use more intelligent tools. We arguably employ advanced technologies that capture, mimic, and then replace our cognitive skills, which we then no longer need to exercise ourselves. This precedes any metaphysical debate, since such practices might stand in a more fundamental conflict with extended cognition. The counter-hypothesis of extracted cognition states that we primarily tend to use tools that initially attain and eventually displace our cognitive responsibilities and involvements. This paper evaluates extended and extracted cognition by comparing theoretical, practical, and ethical arguments respectively. If extracted cognition describes most convincingly how such tool interactions shape our kind of cognition, then we may also endorse ""The Extracted Mind"". ",year_navigation_2025_page_1

Such inferences are not allowed in standard default logic of the Reiter tradition, but are reasonable by analogy to the Deduction Theorem for classical logic. Our main contribution is a formal framework for inclusive default reasoning. The framework has a solid philosophical foundation, it draws conclusions non-trivially different from non-inclusive frameworks, and it exhibits a host of benchmark properties deemed desirable in the literature--e.g., that extensions always exist and are consistent.

Although suitable for empirical assessment, this requirement encounters different limitations when used to analyze actual scientific evidence. The current paper addresses this issue, reformulating Craver et al.'s matching condition. The revised criterion focuses on detecting relevant scientific evidence concerning the activities of the targeted constituent. In particular, it proposes to assess some marker of the interaction between the external, non-biological constituent and other biological components involved in the mechanisms underneath the (putatively) extended phenomenon.

This paper examines the reasoning behind the translation of the exclusion axiom into the exclusion postulate. Section 2 clarifies the exclusion axiom and defends it against common objections. Section 3 explores the broader question of how axioms should be translated into postulates within IIT's framework. Section 4 outlines the ontological principles underlying the latest formulation of IIT, whereas Sect. 5 focuses on the justification of the second principle, which clarifies how causal powers should be ascribed to physical entities. Drawing on these discussions, the exclusion postulate is then abductively inferred from the exclusion axiom.

"ChatGPT, extended: large language models and the extended mind.",,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SMACEL,"Recent research has relied on the use of fine-tuning techniques to incorporate philosophical knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). The present paper outlines an alternative approach to the development of such systems--one that is rooted in a technique known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In contrast to fine-tuning, RAG does not seek to adjust the internal parameters (or internal memory) of an LLM. Instead, RAG relies on the retrieval of information from an externally-situated store, which functions as a form of non-parametric (or external) memory. Applying this technique to the works of the contemporary philosopher Andy Clark yields Digital Andy: an LLM that is able to respond to questions about the extended mind. This serves as a practical demonstration of RAG-based techniques, highlighting how philosophical knowledge can be 'incorporated' into an LLM without the need for additional machine learning. But Digital Andy's reliance on extra-systemic resources also raises questions about the scope of active externalist theorizing, encouraging us to consider Digital Andy's status as an extended cognitive/computational system. Addressing these questions reveals some interesting points of convergence between the philosophical effort to understand the extended mind and the technological effort to build the next generation of LLMs. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
The multiplicity objection against uploading optimism.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/WEBTMO-5,"Could we transfer you from your biological substrate to an electronic hardware by simulating your brain on a computer? The answer to this question divides optimists and pessimists about mind uploading. Optimists believe that you can genuinely survive the transition; pessimists think that surviving mind uploading is impossible. An influential argument against uploading optimism is the multiplicity objection. In a nutshell, the objection is as follows: If uploading optimism were true, it should be possible to create not only one, but multiple digital versions of you. However, you cannot literally become many. Hence, you cannot survive even a single instance of uploading, and optimism about uploading is misguided. In this paper, I will first spell out the multiplicity objection in detail and then provide a two-pronged defence against the objection. First, uploading pessimists cannot establish that uploading optimism has the contentious implication. Second, it is in fact plausible to think that we could become multiple distinct persons.

Do language models lack communicative intentions?,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/ATTDLM,"In some recent work, some psychologists, linguists, AI researchers, and philosophers (e.g., Shanahan, 2022; Bender & Koller, 2020; Montemayor, 2021; Bender et al., 2021) have argued that, despite producing convincing human-like linguistic output, large language models do not possess linguistic competence on the ground that they lack communicative intention. Among the proponents of this position, the notion of communicative intention is entertained as the liveliest candidate for a distinguishing characteristic of human cognition vis-a-vis LLMs and as such as at least one of the features which accounts for the characteristic mentality of humans. I demonstrate that such a position is largely driven by strong Gricean assumptions about the nature of linguistic competence that I argue is now known to be empirically untenable. Moreover, I show that once we give up these assumptions and fairly assess the architecture of both LLM and human cognitive architectures, we will find no good reasons to suppose large language models lack communicative intentions. I thus reject communicative intentions as a viable ground on which to understand the difference between LLMs and humans and thus as a characteristic mark of human mentality.

Can simulations aid counterfactual reasoning?,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/GANCSA-3,"Some artificial intelligence systems attempt to implement counterfactual reasoning using computer simulations.

On the usual understanding of counterfactuals, 'If a vehicle had decelerated, snow would have been white' is true, and the actual world factors into the evaluation of counterfactuals with true antecedents. But we would expect 'In a simulation of a decelerating vehicle, snow would be white' to be false, and for the actual world not to factor into our consideration of what happens in simulations with true stipulations. This paper formulates a logic to model simulation-based reasoning and identifies necessary conditions for the logics of counterfactuals and simulations to align. The investigations imply that simulation-based artificial systems can reliably implement counterfactual reasoning only insofar as it has an adequate notion of similarity between worlds, relevance between propositions, and compatibility between stipulations.

Generative midtended cognition and Artificial Intelligence: thinging with thinging things.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/BARGMC-2,"This paper introduces the concept of ""generative midtended cognition"", that explores the integration of generative AI technologies with human cognitive processes. The term ""generative"" reflects AI's ability to iteratively produce structured outputs, while ""midtended"" captures the potential hybrid (human-AI) nature of the process. It stands between traditional conceptions of _in_tended creation, understood as steered or directed from with_in_, and _ex_tended processes that bring exo-biological processes into the creative process. We examine the working of current generative technologies (based on multimodal transformer architectures typical of large language models like ChatGPT) to explain how they can transform human cognitive agency beyond what the conceptual resources of standard theories of extended cognition can capture. We suggest that the type of cognitive activity typical of the coupling between a human and generative technologies is closer (but not equivalent) to social cognition than to classical extended cognitive paradigms. Yet, it deserves a specific treatment. We provide an explicit definition of _generative midtended cognition_ in which we treat interventions by AI systems as constitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes. Furthermore, we distinguish two dimensions of generative hybrid creativity: 1. Width: captures the sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single letter to the whole historical and surrounding data), 2. Depth: captures the granularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended cognition stands in the middle depth between _conversational_ forms of cognition in which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and micro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes. Finally, the paper discusses the potential risks and benefits of widespread generative AI adoption, including the challenges of authenticity, generative power asymmetry, and creative boost or atrophy.

"A logic for bounded multi-agent reasoning: deductive inference, introspection, and attribution.",,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SOLALF-3,"Logics for belief as spin-offs of normal modal logics are susceptible to criticisms regarding their potential to model human reasoning, especially in light of empirical evidence on people's performance in reasoning tasks. The agents are modelled as unlimited reasoners, who perform deductive inferences, introspect, and reason about others' reasoning, despite bounds of memory or time. To amend this, we propose a hyperintensional doxastic logic for reasoning in a multi-agent setting, which is better aligned with facts on human cognition. We introduce (i) a resource-sensitive impossible-worlds semantics, to account for the fallibility of real reasoners, and (ii) dynamic operators and model updates, inspired by Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), to represent actions that, when affordable, can refine the zero- or higher- order beliefs of agents. The resulting system is applied to case-studies of multi-agent reasoning scenarios. It is thus argued that the framework does justice to non-idealized agents and that it does so in a uniform way, i.e. applicable to both deductive and higher-order reasoning, and in a balanced way, i.e. avoiding criticisms often fired against similar attempts. We finally illustrate a technical connection between this and syntactic approaches against the problem of logical omniscience; this allows us to exploit DEL techniques in obtaining a sound and complete axiomatization.

It is less clear whether Bayesian updating alone is sufficient to explain the genesis and evolution of belief space, as it appears challenging to explain the generation of truly novel original priors (structure learning) or the transition to the direct opposite of the initial prior through Bayesian updating. To address this challenge, we suggest integrating Bayesian updating with the principles of the dialectical development of thought as conceived in Hegel's work. We argue that applying dialectics and the freeenergy principle to Bayesian inference makes the evolution of belief space both its emergent and imperative property. We naturalize this idea by illustrating how behaviors of different complexity from the molecular mechanisms of the simplest biological behavior, such as bacterial chemotaxis, through psychopathology can be viewed in the 'dialectical Bayes' framework. This framework is used to explore the cognitive dynamics of physical and emotional pain and to propose a mechanism of chronic suffering. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
Extending the extended self: a mediational-constitutional proposal.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/PREETE-2,"This paper explores the mediational and constitutional role of technical images (both analogue and digital) for the definition and continuity of the sense of self, proposing a new framework within the extended mind theory grounded in recent approaches to memory. Traditional cognitive science often views the mind as confined within the brain, but we argue that cognition is not merely extended but fundamentally constituted through ongoing material engagements with technical images within specific sociocultural contexts. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates cognitive archaeology, media theory, and cognitive sciences, emphasising the dynamic, embodied, and situated nature of cognition. This perspective shifts the understanding of the mind from a static, internal entity to a dynamic, distributed process continually mediated through organismic transactions in the environment. Building on this tradition of studies in the extended mind, we introduce the Mediational-Constitutional Principle, arguing that technical images not only trigger cognitive processes but actively constitute them. In the paper, we illustrate how technical images mediate and constitute the sense of self because they are central in how memory is continually re-enacted in specific sociomaterial environments made of people, things, and practices. These images function as automatic ecological records, blending past and present, influencing personal narratives and memory. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
"The AI-mediated communication dilemma: epistemic trust, social media, and the challenge of generative artificial intelligence.",,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SAHTAC,"The rapid adoption of commercial Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) products raises important questions around the impact this technology will have on our communicative interactions. This paper provides an analysis of some of the potential implications that Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) may have on epistemic trust in online communications, specifically on social media. We argue that AI-MC poses a risk to epistemic trust being diminished in online communications on both normative and descriptive grounds. Descriptively, AI-MC seems to (roughly) lower levels of epistemic trust. Normatively, we argue that this brings about the following dilemma. On the one hand, there are at least some instances where we should epistemically trust AI-MC less, and therefore the reduction in epistemic trust is justified in these instances. On the other hand, there are also instances where we epistemically trust AI-MC less, but this reduction in epistemic trust is not justified, resulting in discrimination and epistemic injustice in these instances. The difficulty in knowing which of these two groups any instance of AI-MC belongs to brings about the AI-MC dilemma: We must choose between maintaining normal levels of epistemic trust and risking epistemic gullibility when reduced trust is justified, or adopting generally reduced epistemic trust and risking epistemic injustice when such reduced trust is unjustified. Navigating this choice between problematic alternatives creates a significant challenge for social media as an epistemic environment. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
We have never been Cartesian.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/TOOWHN,"Humanism is the traditional approach in many disciplines, including history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology. Humanists tend to assume that there is an important distinction between the knowing subject and the rest of the world. Posthumanism challenges this assumption, asking us to examine how the distinction between subject and object is constructed in the first place. To do so, posthumanists argue that we must abandon our traditional resources for understanding the knowing subject. In its place, we must adopt a radical new notion of agency that encompasses humans and nonhumans. This paper argues that, although posthumanism teaches us a valuable lesson, the real problem lies not with humanism, but with Cartesianism. To show this, I develop a new version of humanism by drawing on two anti-Cartesian strands within recent philosophy of mind: _the extended mind thesis_ and _mental fictionalism_. The result is a view that allows us to retain our traditional resources for understanding the knowing subject, while recognising that the nature of that subject can change over time.

How to be a realist about computational neuroscience.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/WILHTB-7,"Recently, a version of realism has been offered to address the simplification strategies used in computational neuroscience. According to this view, computational models provide us with knowledge about the brain, but they should not be taken literally in _any_ sense, even rejecting the idea that the brain performs computations (computationalism). I acknowledge the need for considerations regarding simplification strategies in neuroscience and how they contribute to our interpretations of computational models; however, I argue that whether we should accept or reject computationalism about the brain is a separate issue that can be addressed independently by a philosophical theory of physical computation. This takes seriously the idea that the brain performs computations while also taking an analogical stance toward computational models in neuroscience. I call this version of realism ""Analogical Computational Realism."" Analogical Computational Realism is a realist view in virtue of being committed to computationalism while taking certain computational models to pick out real patterns that provide a how-possibly explanation without also thinking that the model is literally implemented in the brain.

Cognitive offloading and the causal structure of human action.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/BRICOA-6,"The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on 'cognitive offloading', HEC's defenders claim that information processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is sometimes 'genuinely' cognitive. But while debates about offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of action as a kind of interface between separately constituted intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic. But while this view of agency has been popularised - most prominently by Donald Davidson - as analytic philosophy of action's 'standard story', it has come under pressure from philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe's very different account. According to this, actions express an agent's intention only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically structured worldly context. In this paper, I'll argue that HEC's supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is, they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of human agency's general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
Home as mind: AI extenders and affective ecologies in dementia care.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/KRUHAM,"I consider applications of ""AI extenders"" to dementia care. AI extenders are AI-powered technologies that extend minds in ways interestingly different from old-school tech like notebooks, sketch pads, models, and microscopes. I focus on AI extenders as ambiance: so thoroughly embedded into things and spaces that they fade from view and become part of a subject's taken-for-granted background. Using dementia care as a case study, I argue that ambient AI extenders are promising because they afford richer and more durable forms of multidimensional integration than do old-school extenders like Otto's notebook. They can be tailored, in fine-grained ways along multiple timescales, to a user's particular needs, values, and preferences--and crucially, they can do much of this self-optimizing on their own. I discuss why this is so, why it matters, and its potential impact on affect and agency. I conclude with some worries in need of further discussion. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1

Inkeri Koskinen has recently argued that this poses special problems for a widespread view in social epistemology according to which thick normative trust between researchers is necessary to handle opacity: if DNNs are essentially opaque, there simply exists nobody who could be trusted to understand all the aspects a DNN picks up during training. In this paper, I present a counterexample from scientific practice, AlphaFold2. I argue that for epistemic reliance on an opaque system, trust is not necessary, but reliability is. What matters is whether, for a given context, the reliability of a DNN has been compellingly established by empirical means and whether there exist trustable researchers who have performed such evaluations adequately.

"Shifting boundaries, extended minds: ambient technology and extended allostatic control.",,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/WHISBE,"This article applies the thesis of the extended mind to ambient smart environments. These systems are characterised by an environment, such as a home or classroom, infused with multiple, highly networked streams of smart technology working in the background, learning about the user and operating without an explicit interface or any intentional sensorimotor engagement from the user. We analyse these systems in the context of work on the ""classical"" extended mind, characterised by conditions such as ""trust and glue"" and phenomenal transparency, and find that these conditions are ill-suited to describing our engagement with ambient smart environments. We then draw from the active inference framework, a theory of brain function which casts cognition as a process of embodied uncertainty minimisation, to develop a version of the extended mind grounded in a process ontology, where the boundaries of mind are understood to be multiple and always shifting. Given this more fluid account of the extended mind, we argue that ambient smart environments should be thought of as extended allostatic control systems, operating more or less invisibly to support an agent's biological capacity for minimising uncertainty over multiple, interlocking timescales. Thus, we account for the functionality of ambient smart environments as extended systems, and in so doing, utilise a markedly different version of the classical thesis of extended mind.

Good classification matters: conceptual engineering in data science.,,2025,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/KHLGCM,"Recent years have seen incredible advances in our abilities to gather and store data, as well as in the computational power and methods--most prominently in machine learning--to do things with those data. These advances have given rise to the emerging field ""data science."" Because of its immense power for providing practically useful information about the world, data science is a field of increasing importance. This paper argues that a core part of what data scientists are doing should be understood as conceptual engineering. At all stages of the data science process, data scientists need to deliberate about, evaluate, and make classificatory choices in a variety of ways, including as part of training and evaluating machine learning models. Viewing these activities as involved in conceptual engineering offers a new way to think about them, one that helps to clarify what is at stake in them, what sorts of considerations are relevant, and how to systematically think about the choices faced. Given the increasing importance of data science, if conceptual engineering is relevant for activities in data science, this also highlights the relevance and impact of conceptual engineering as a method. Furthermore, the paper also suggests that machine learning opens distinctive and novel ways in which data scientists engage in conceptual engineering. ",year_navigation_2025_page_1
Meaning and understanding in large language models.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/HAVMAU,"Can a machine understand the meanings of natural language?

This article critically evaluates the prevailing tendency to regard machine language performance as mere syntactic manipulation and the imitations of understanding, which is only partial and very shallow, without sufficient grounding in the world. The article analyses the views on possible ways of grounding as a condition for successful understanding in LLMs and offers an alternative way in view of the prevailing belief that the success of understanding depends mainly on the referential grounding. An alternative conception seeks to show that semantic fragmentism offers a viable account of natural language understanding and explains how LLMs ground the meanings of linguistic expressions. Uncovering how meanings are grounded allows us to also explain why LLMs' ability to understand is possible and so remarkably successful. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
What is a theory of neural representation for?,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/RICWIA-8,"This paper asks how representational notions figure into cognitive science, especially neuroscience.

I argue that this is a mistake. Our ultimate questions, as philosophers of cognitive science, are about the function and epistemology of cognitive scientific explanations--in this case, explanations that use representational notions. To answer those questions we must understand what representational notions contribute to science: what they enable scientists to do or explain, and how. But I show that we can do this without raising traditional and vexing questions about the definition of neural representation, or the nature of a property or relation that notion picks out. Taking this approach, I defend a realist account of representational explanation that underwrites important connections between philosophy and neuroscience. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1

Taking inspiration (Sect. 2) from research in these fields we present -with the help of some imagination- a futurist scenario of complete human-computer integration. We discuss a set of practical benefits and risks associated with the implementation of such a scenario, which -despite being fictional at the time of writing- is likely to be realized soon. We frame our discussion (Sect. 3) in the context of research conducted in the cognitive sciences on the extended mind thesis (EMT).

We further problematize (Sect. 4) around the significance of this envisaged scenario for research on neuro-rights. We therefore also discuss a series of ethical challenges related to their potential infringement.

Do opaque algorithms have functions?,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/HURDOA-2,"The functions of technical artifacts are closely associated with design. Increasingly, however, we depend on technologies that are not designed: algorithms produced using machine learning (ML). Machine learning uses automated optimization processes to produce algorithms that are often opaque even to developers. I argue that these opaque ML models cannot be ascribed functions on the leading design-based account, the ICE theory of Houkes and Vermaas (Technical functions: On the use and design of artefacts, Springer, 2010). Specifically, I argue that the form of rational justification that the ICE theory provides for the uses of artifacts in typical cases cannot be provided for opaque algorithms, since developers lack the necessary ""support beliefs"" about how the algorithm works. This does not mean that opaque ML models have no proper functions at all; rather, it lends support to non-intentional theories of technical functions, modeled after function theories in the sciences. However, these theories are meant to perform different work than the ICE theory. As a result, the kind of justification they provide for artifact use is weaker than that provided by the ICE theory and fails to justify many ongoing uses of algorithms. The paper therefore has two upshots. First, opaque ML models lack intentional technical functions. Second, while they may have functions on alternative theories, in many cases these functional ascriptions still leave the use of algorithms unjustified. Rather than extensions of our agency, opaque algorithms are a kind of found object with unknown properties that may or may not be suited to the purposes to which we put them.

On the one hand, technical artifacts are material objects-they are constituted by their physical components and structures. On the other hand, technical artifacts are intentional objects in virtue of their teleological nature--they are _for_ some purpose that is contingent on the intentional states of agents. I argue that this view is false when properly understood. To do this, I develop a theory of technical functions that reduces functions to physical dispositions (Dispositional Account of Technical Functions, DAF). First, I argue that the different notions of technical functions are best understood with reference to dispositions. Then, I argue that technical functions, like dispositions, are modal properties that manifest under appropriate circumstances. Further, I argue that the seemingly teleological nature of technical functions can be accounted for with reference to user expectations. Phrases like ""proper use,"" ""malfunctioning,"" and ""accidental use"" are intentional concepts that agents ascribe to relevant dispositions. Hence, an artifact is a physical object with dispositions, and subcategories of technical functions are ultimately socio-cultural facts about what we expect from the use of artifacts.

This paper provides a novel challenge to mind uploading, focusing on the distinction between abstract objects and concrete individuals. Uploads are abstract objects, while currently, persons are concrete indi- viduals. This presents a dilemma: if the mind is concrete, uploading it to a computer is impossible. Alternatively, if mind uploading is feasible, the resulting abstract upload cannot be numerically identical to the original person. Furthermore, by dif- ferentiating survival from persistence, this paper argues that concrete persons might survive as abstract uploads, but only in a highly restricted sense, without preserving their numerical identity. Despite these philosophical hurdles, practical reasons for considering mind uploading as life nears its end still need to be acknowledged. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1

In this paper, I will argue for a different approach--that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans' ( 1982 ) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan's ( 1984, 2004, 2005 ) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality--dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system--allows for the plausible result that LLM outputs are meaningful.

Why and how to construct an epistemic justification of machine learning?,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SPEWAH,"Consider a set of shuffled observations drawn from a fixed probability distribution over some instance domain. What enables learning of inductive generalizations which proceed from such a set of observations? The scenario is worthwhile because it epistemically characterizes most of machine learning. This kind of learning from observations is also inverse and ill-posed. What reduces the non-uniqueness of its result and, thus, its problematic epistemic justification, which stems from a one-to-many relation between the observations and many learnable generalizations? The paper argues that this role belongs to any complexity regularization which satisfies Norton's Material Theory of Induction (MTI) by localizing the inductive risk to facts in the given domain. A prime example of the localization is the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) about overparameterized neural networks. The explanation of MTI's role in complexity regularization of neural networks is provided by analyzing the stability of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), an inductive rule that controls the learning process and leads to an inductive generalization on the given set of observations. In cases where ERM might become asymptotically unstable, making the justification of the generalization by uniform convergence unavailable, LTH and MTI can be used to define a local stability. A priori, overparameterized neural networks are such cases and the combination of LTH and MTI can block ERM's trivialization caused by equalizing the strengths of its inductive support for risk minimization. We bring closer the investigation of generalization in artificial neural networks and the study of inductive inference and show the division of labor between MTI and the optimality justifications (developed by Gerhard Schurz) in machine learning.

We argue that ambient smart environments should be understood as playing an'upstream' role, shaping an agent's field of affordances in real time, in an adaptive way that supports an optimal grip on a field of affordances. We characterise this optimal grip using precision weighting, and in terms of allostatic control, drawing an analogy with the role of precision weighting in metacognitive processes. One key insight we present is that ambient smart environments may support allostatic control not only by simplifying an agent's problem space, but by increasing uncertainty, in order to destabilise calcified, sub-optimal, psychological and behavioural patterns. In short, we lay an empirically-grounded theoretical foundation for understanding ambient smart environments, and for answering related philosophical questions around agency, trust, and subjective wellbeing.

To address this transition, I analyze the position of the German philosopher Thomas Fuchs, who represents one possible approach to the problem of the relationship between bio-inspired technology and biology. While Fuchs defends the idea of a unique ontological space for humans, this article contends that his categorical distinctions face challenges in establishing a robust epistemic foundation necessary to ground the transition from biology to technology. After identifying at least three interwoven reasons for rejecting Fuchs' epistemic foundation, I ask how, through what methods, and by means of which practices the newly bio-inspired object is accessed and shaped. Expanding on philosophy of science and technology in practice, I argue that the plurality of answers to this question provides a possible epistemological foundation _within_ the different frameworks of practices that produce the bio-inspired object. In addressing the potential epistemological foundation for pluralistically grounding the transition from biological models to technological ones, my approach helps us: (i) concretize and examine the relationship between biological and technological models, and (ii) investigate the features and validity of bio-inspired objects, effectively offering a more concrete and pluralistic picture of what bio-inspired sciences and technologies are and what they can (or cannot) do.

A Credence-based Theory-heavy Approach to Non-human Consciousness.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/DEWACT,"Many different methodological approaches have been proposed to infer the presence of consciousness in non-human systems. In this paper, a version of the theory-heavy approach is defended. Theory-heavy approaches rely heavily on considerations from theories of consciousness to make inferences about non-human consciousness. Recently, the theory-heavy approach has been critiqued in the form of Birch's (Nous, 56(1): 133-153, 2022) dilemma of demandingness and Shevlin's (Mind & Language, 36(2): 297-314, 2021) specificity problem. However, both challenges implicitly assume an inapt characterization of the theory-heavy approach. I argue that an alternative characterization of the approach, what I call a credence-based theory-heavy approach, avoids these challenges. Theorists can generate interpretations of their theory, at different levels of generality, and operationalize these into theory-informed markers. These theory-informed are assigned a likelihood and are used to assess the probability that a target system is conscious. In providing this characterization, and mapping out the possible ways in which a credence-based theory-heavy approach can be fleshed out, the aim is to situate the theory-heavy approach as a more compelling approach than it is currently being perceived as. Our attention, then, needs to towards remaining challenges such as the consensus problem and the problem of calibrating the likelihoods associated with theory-informed markers.

This paper builds a working conception of such injustice and explores it further. Let us call it informational injustice. Informational injustice is a consequence of informational asymmetries between at least two agents, which are deeply exacerbated due to modern information and communication technologies but do not necessarily originate with them. Informational injustice is the injustice of having information from an informational surplus being used to disadvantage the agent with less information. -/- This paper argues that informational injustice exploits an agent as a knower, specifically exploiting the agent's limitation in possessing or processing information--an agent is exploited because she is not informed or lacks in her ability to process information. In the case of lack of information, the agent simply does not know the information under consideration; a person is algorithmically manipulated or nudged to buy a product or vote for someone. In the case of a lack of capacity to process information, the agent simply cannot use the information, despite having access to it, to reach epistemically valuable states such as knowledge; a lawyer dupes you because he knows more about the inner workings of a courtroom and the law. Technically, you have access to the information your lawyer has, but you cannot make use of it due to constraints on time and cognitive effort. Informational injustice excludes the harmed agent from participating in knowledge practices. Thus, informational injustice is also a kind of epistemic exclusion. -/- After fixing the concept of informational injustice, the paper distinguishes between two kinds of informational injustices: interactional informational injustice and structural informational injustice. The former concerns interactions between agents, while the latter concerns social structures that emerge out of interactions between agents. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1

Social learning in models and minds.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/YONSLI,"After more than a century in which social learning was blackboxed by evolutionary biologists, psychologists and economists, there is now a thriving industry in cognitive neuroscience producing computational models of learning from and about other agents. This is a hugely positive development. The tools of computational cognitive neuroscience are rigorous and precise. They have the potential to prise open the black box. However, we argue that, from the perspective of a scientific realist, these tools are not yet being applied in an optimal way. To fulfil their potential, the shiny new methods of cognitive neuroscience need to be better coordinated with old-fashioned, contrastive experimental designs. Inferences from model complexity to cognitive complexity, of the kind made by those who favour lean interpretations of behaviour ('associationists'), require social learning to be tested in challenging task environments. Inferences from cognitive complexity to social specificity, made by those who favour rich interpretations ('mentalists'), call for non-social control experiments. A parsimonious model that fits current data is a good start, but carefully designed experiments are needed to distinguish models that tell us how social learning _could_ be done from those that tell us how it is _really_ done.

By demonstrating how misrepresentation is necessary for learning from mistakes and explaining certain failures of action, we argue that fallible rational agents must have mental representations with causally relevant vehicles of content. Our argument contributes to ongoing discussions in philosophy of mind and cognitive science by challenging anti-realist views about the nature of mental representation, and by highlighting the importance of understanding how different agents can misrepresent in pursuit of their goals. While there are potential rebuttals to our claim, our opponents must explain how agents can be rational without having mental representations. This is because mental representation is grounded in rationality. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
Scrutinizing the foundations: could large language models be solipsistic?,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/ESASTF,"In artificial intelligence literature, ""delusions"" are characterized as the generation of unfaithful output from reliable source content. There is an extensive literature on computer-generated delusions, ranging from visual hallucinations, like the production of nonsensical images in Computer Vision, to nonsensical text generated by (natural) language models, but this literature is predominantly taxonomic. In a recent research paper, however, a group of scientists from DeepMind successfully presented a formal treatment of an entire class of delusions in generative AI models (i.e., models based on a transformer architecture, both with and without RLHF--reinforcement learning with human feedback, such as BERT, GPT-3 or the more recent GPT-3.5), referred to as auto-suggestive delusions. Auto-suggestive delusions are not mere unfaithful output, but are self-induced by the transformer models themselves. Typically, these delusions have been subsumed under the concept of exposure bias, but exposure bias alone does not elucidate their nature. In order to address their nature, I will introduce a formal framework that clarifies the probabilistic delusions capable of explaining exposure bias in a broad manner. This will serve as the foundation for exploring auto-suggestive delusions in language models. Next, an examination of self- or auto-suggestive delusions will be undertaken, by drawing an analogy with the rule-following problematic from the philosophy of mind and language. Finally, I will argue that this comprehensive approach leads to the suggestion that transformers, large language models in particular, may develop in a manner that touches upon solipsism and the emergence of a private language, in a weak sense.

"Exploring, expounding & ersatzing: a three-level account of deep learning models in cognitive neuroscience.",,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SUBEEB,"Deep learning (DL) is a statistical technique for pattern classification through which AI researchers train artificial neural networks containing multiple layers that process massive amounts of data. I present a three-level account of explanation that can be reasonably expected from DL models in cognitive neuroscience and that illustrates the explanatory dynamics within a future-biased research program (Feest Philosophy of Science 84:1165-1176, 2017 ; Doerig et al. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience 24:431-450, 2023 ). By relying on the mechanistic framework (Craver Explaining the brain: Mechanisms and the mosaic unity of neuroscience. Clarendon, 2007 ; Stinson Eppuor si muove: Doing history and philosophy of Science with Peter Machamer. Springer, 2017, The Routledge Handbook of the computational mind. Routledge, 2018 ), I develop an account that corresponds to the stages of mechanism discovery, i.e., our shifting epistemic position and epistemic goals, and propose a representative model for each level. Generic, theoretical DL models at _Level 1_ address the general features of a cognitive phenomenon through exploration and provide us with how-possibly explanations. On the other hand, DL models at _Level 2_ either identify the interaction between the features or represent the epistemic stage when the researcher is still unsure if the modeled features are crucial or arbitrary. These models should provide us with how-plausibly explanations. Finally, specific DL models of specific brain areas, i.e., ersatz models filled with relevant cognitive and neuroscientific details, are at _Level 3_. At this level, a researcher can advance how-actually explanations of cognitive phenomena. The main strength of this account is that it elucidates both _global explanatory dynamics_ and _local explanatory dynamics_ (cf. Dresow Synthese 199:10441-10474, 2021 ). The former occurs when the transition between levels happens in accordance with the process of obtaining more details about a particular cognitive phenomenon through multiple DL models. The latter, meanwhile, involves cases in which the transition between levels takes place within a single DL model by elucidating internal mechanisms (e.g., using Explainable AI techniques for rendering models more transparent).

Computational systems as higher-order mechanisms.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/FUECSA-3,"I argue that there are different orders of mechanisms with different constitutive relevance and individuation conditions. In common first-order mechanistic explanations, constitutive relevance norms are captured by the matched-interlevel-experiments condition (Craver et al. (2021) Synthese 199:8807-8828). Regarding individuation, we say that any two mechanisms are of the same type when they have the same concrete components performing the same activities in the same arrangement. By contrast, in higher-order mechanistic explanations, we formulate the decompositions in terms of generalized basic components (GBCs). These GBCs (e.g., logic gates) possess causal properties that are common to a set of physical systems. Mechanistic explanations formulated in terms of GBCs embody the epistemic value of horizontal integration, which aims to explain as many phenomena as possible with a minimal amount of abstract components (Wajnerman Paz (2017a) Philos Psychol 30:213-234). Two higher-order mechanisms are of the same type when they share all the same GBCs, and they are organized as performing the same activities with the same interactions. I use this notion of mechanistic order to enhance the mechanistic account of computation (MAC) and provide an account of the epistemic norms of computational explanation and the nature of medium-independent functional properties and mechanisms. Finally, I use these new conceptual tools to address four criticisms of the MAC. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1
"Functionalism, integrity, and digital consciousness.",,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/SHIFIA-2,"The prospect of consciousness in artificial systems is closely tied to the viability of functionalism about consciousness. Even if consciousness arises from the abstract functional relationships between the parts of a system, it does not follow that any digital system that implements the right functional organization would be conscious. Functionalism requires constraints on what it takes to properly implement an organization. Existing proposals for constraints on implementation relate to the integrity of the parts and states of the realizers of roles in a functional organization. This paper presents and motivates three novel integrity constraints on proper implementation not satisfied by current neural network models. It is proposed that for a system to be conscious, there must be a straightforward relationship between the material entities that compose the system and the realizers of functional roles, that the realizers of the functional roles must play their roles due to internal causal powers, and that they must continue to exist over time.

Paying attention to attention: psychological realism and the attention economy.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/WHIPAT-31,"In recent years, philosophers have identified a number of moral and psychological harms associated with the attention economy (Alysworth & Castro, 2021; Castro & Pham, 2020; Williams, 2018). Missing from many of these accounts of the attention economy, however, is what exactly attention is. As a result of this neglect of the cognitive science of attention, many of these accounts are not empirically credible. They rely on oversimplified and unsophisticated accounts of not only attention, but self- control, and addiction as well. Of note are accounts of the attention economy that rely on the 'brain disease' rhetoric of addiction and subsequent control failures (Aylsworth & Castro, 2021; Bhargava & Velasquez, 2021), accounts that rely on a strict dichotomy of top-down vs. bottom-up attention (Williams, 2018; Aylsworth & Castro, 2021), and accounts that construe attention as a limited resource (Williams, 2018). -/- Drawing on recent work from the neuroscience and psychology of attention, I demonstrate the shortcomings of these accounts and sketch a way forward for an empirically grounded account of the attention economy. These accounts tend to uphold strict dichotomies of voluntary control (e.g., compulsion versus choice, dual-process models of self-control, and top-down versus bottom-up) that cannot account for the complexities of attentional control, mental agency, and decision-making. As such, these empirically and conceptually impoverished accounts cannot adequately address the current so-called crisis of attention. To better understand the harms associated with the attention economy, we need an empirically responsible account of the nature and function of attention and mental agency.

Deep convolutional neural networks are not mechanistic explanations of object recognition.,,2024,Synthese,https://philpapers.org/rec/GRUDCN,"Given the extent of using deep convolutional neural networks to model the mechanism of object recognition, it becomes important to analyse the evidence of their similarity and the explanatory potential of these models. I focus on one frequent method of their comparison--representational similarity analysis, and I argue, first, that it underdetermines these models as how-actually mechanistic explanations. This happens because different similarity measures in this framework pick out different mechanisms across DCNNs and the brain in order to correspond them, and there is no arbitration between them in terms of relevance for object recognition. Second, the reason similarity measures are underdetermining to a large degree stems from the highly idealised nature of these models, which undermines their status as how-possibly mechanistic explanatory models of object recognition as well. Thus, building models with more theoretical consideration and choosing relevant similarity measures may bring us closer to the goal of mechanistic explanation. ",year_navigation_2024_page_1

We argue that, as well as more obvious concerns about the downstream effects of ML-based decision-making, there can be moral grounds for the criticism of these predictions themselves. We introduce and defend a theory of predictive justice, according to which differential model performance for systematically disadvantaged groups can be grounds for moral criticism of the model, independently of its downstream effects. As well as helping resolve some urgent disputes around algorithmic fairness, this theory points the way to a novel dimension of epistemic ethics, related to the recently discussed category of doxastic wrong.

In simple mathematical models of these scenarios, the agents represented by the models can coordinate only if they have common knowledge that they will. As a result, the models predict that the agents will not coordinate in situations where it would be rational to coordinate. I argue that we should resolve this conflict between the models and facts about what it would be rational to do by rejecting common knowledge assumptions implicit in the models. I focus on the assumption that the agents have common knowledge that they are rational, and provide models to show that denying this assumption suffices for a resolution of the paradoxes. I describe how my resolution of the paradoxes fits into a general story about the relationship between rationality in situations involving a single agent and rationality in situations involving many agents.

These counterfactuals are counterpossibles, i.e. they have metaphysically impossible antecedents. They thus pose a challenge to the orthodoxy about counterfactuals, which would treat them as uniformly true. What's more, I argue that these counterpossibles don't just appear in the periphery of relative computability theory but instead they play an ineliminable role in the development of the theory.

In the present paper we show that an analogous line of reasoning can be raised against the numerical measurement (i.e., numerical representation) of physical magnitudes, and we argue that this result is a reductio ad absurdum of the challenge to computational skepticism. We then use this reductio to get clearer about both (i) what's wrong with Putnam's and Searle's arguments against computationalism, and (ii) what can be learned about both computational implementation and numerical measurement from the shortcomings of both sorts of skeptical argument.

We also argue that proponents of a right to an explanation carve off certain kinds of automated decisions as requiring more justification than others in similar areas of social (and natural) science policy, a demarcation we argue is unjustified.

I work out the details of her argument and worsen her conclusion. I focus on public transparency - that is, transparency to the public over expert domains. I offer two versions of the criticism. First, the epistemic intrusion argument: The drive to transparency forces experts to explain their reasoning to non-experts. But expert reasons are, by their nature, often inaccessible to non-experts. So the demand for transparency can pressure experts to act only in those ways for which they can offer public justification. Second, the intimate reasons argument: In many cases of practical deliberation, the relevant reasons are intimate to a community and not easily explicable to those who lack a particular shared background. The demand for transparency, then, pressures community members to abandon the special understanding and sensitivity that arises from their particular experiences. Transparency, it turns out, is a form of surveillance. By forcing reasoning into the explicit and public sphere, transparency roots out corruption -- but it also inhibits the full application of expert skill, sensitivity, and subtle shared understandings. The difficulty here arises from the basic fact that human knowledge vastly outstrips any individual's capacities. We all depend on experts, which makes us vulnerable to their biases and corruption. But if we try to wholly secure our trust -- if we leash groups of experts to pursuing only the goals and taking only the actions that can be justified to the non-expert public -- then we will undermine their expertise. We need both trust and transparency, but they are in essential tension. This is a deep practical dilemma; it admits of no neat resolution, but only painful compromise. ",year_navigation_2021_page_1
"Too much attention, too little self.",,2020,Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,https://philpapers.org/rec/JENTMA-5,"This is a good time for such a substantial book on Buddhaghosa. His ideas may be more difficult to digest than those of contemporary authors, but Ganeri convincingly argues for their relevance. Together with Ganeri's considerable interpretive and philosophical work, Buddhaghosa's view helps to fill out a perspective that is popular in cognitive science, in which the self is replaced by systems. In this case, the self is replaced by systems of attention, a view that Ganeri calls 'Attentionalism.' In this review I will focus on two aspects of the account that I find especially puzzling, with the hope that this leads to further elucidation, whether by Ganeri or others. Specifically, I will focus on the concepts of ekaggata, or ""placing,"" and anatta, or ""no-self,"" as interpreted by Ganeri. ",year_navigation_2020_page_1

On statistical criteria of algorithmic fairness.,,2021,Philosophy & Public Affairs,https://philpapers.org/rec/HEDOSC,"Predictive algorithms are playing an increasingly prominent role in society, being used to predict recidivism, loan repayment, job performance, and so on. With this increasing influence has come an increasing concern with the ways in which they might be unfair or biased against individuals in virtue of their race, gender, or, more generally, their group membership. Many purported criteria of algorithmic fairness concern statistical relationships between the algorithm's predictions and the actual outcomes, for instance requiring that the rate of false positives be equal across the relevant groups. We might seek to ensure that algorithms satisfy all of these purported fairness criteria. But a series of impossibility results shows that this is impossible, unless base rates are equal across the relevant groups. What are we to make of these pessimistic results? I argue that none of the purported criteria, except for a calibration criterion, are necessary conditions for fairness, on the grounds that they can all be simultaneously violated by a manifestly fair and uniquely optimal predictive algorithm, even when base rates are equal. I conclude with some general reflections on algorithmic fairness. ",year_navigation_2021_page_1

The Right to Be Forgotten and the Value of an Open Future.,,2024,Ethics,https://philpapers.org/rec/PRETRT-3,"This article seeks to shed light on debates about the right to be forgotten by offering a new account of the right as grounded in the confidence that the direction of one's life is up to one and worth the trouble that it takes to direct it. I show how this confidence is supported by what the right actually provides: the possibility of new social interactions unconditioned by information about one's past. This view avoids pitfalls facing other accounts of the right's moral basis, clarifies its relation to rights of privacy, and resolves several puzzles thought to face its practical application.
