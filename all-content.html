        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>About My Research</h3>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Philosophy at Vanderbilt University exploring the intersection of classical philosophical traditions and artificial intelligence. My research examines how premodern conceptions of rationality can illuminate contemporary debates about AI ethics and cognition. I investigate whether large-scale AI models resemble human cognition in ways that challenge assumptions about human uniqueness, and consider what this means for moral status and our ethical frameworks. I also lead initiatives on AI applications in humanities research and teaching with Vanderbilt's RPW Center.</p>
        
        <h3>السيرة الذاتية البحثية</h3>
        <p dir="rtl" lang="ar">
            لقد كرّستُ جزءًا كبيرًا من حياتي الأكاديمية لدراسة الفلسفة الإسلامية الكلاسيكية، مع تركيز خاص على دور الدين والتعددية الدينية في الشهادة الموثوقة. بحثتُ في نظريات العقل والإدراك، مع اهتمام دقيق بالطرق التي حاول بها الفلاسفة في العصور الوسطى استيعاب البصائر النبوية كشهادة موثوقة. كما درستُ نظرية الحب عند ابن عربي في كتابه "الفتوحات المكية" ووجدتُ أن الشعر العربي من أروع ما قُدّم في الأدب العالمي. هذه الدراسات أثرت بشكل عميق فهمي للعقلانية والإدراك البشري، وتشكّل أساسًا مهمًا لبحثي الحالي حول الذكاء الاصطناعي.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ἡ φιλοσοφικὴ ἀρχή</h3>
        <p lang="grc">
            Τὴν ἀρχαίαν Ἑλληνικὴν φιλοσοφίαν πολὺν χρόνον ἐμελέτησα, μάλιστα τὴν μίμησιν παρὰ Πλάτωνι, Ἀριστοτέλει, Φίλωνι καὶ ἄλλοις. Ἐξετάσα πῶς οὗτοι οἱ φιλόσοφοι τὸ ὄντως ὂν ἀπὸ τῆς μιμήσεως διεχώριζον. Τῶν ἀρχαίων ποιητῶν, μάλιστα τοῦ Ὁμήρου, τὰ ἔπη ἡδέως ἀνέλεξα. Αὕτη ἡ παιδεία τὴν νῦν ἐμὴν ἔρευναν περὶ τοῦ νοῦ καὶ τῆς μιμήσεως ἐν τῷ τεχνητῷ νοῖ θεμελιοῖ.

        <p>Cameron Pattison | Vanderbilt University</p>
        <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:cameron.pattison@vanderbilt.edu">cameron.pattison@vanderbilt.edu</a></p>

        <h2>Research Areas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>AI Ethics and Philosophy of Mind</li>
            <li>Justice and Fairness in AI Systems</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Research Journey</h2>
        <h3>Classical Foundations</h3>
        <p>My research began with questions about cognition and reason in the Aristotelian tradition and its development in the Islamic philosophical world, examining how premodern thinkers grappled with rationality, perception, and human nature.</p>
        
        <h3>Bridge to Contemporary Questions</h3>
        <p>This historical investigation led to deeper questions about what cognition means—human or otherwise—and how these classical frameworks can inform our understanding of artificial intelligence.</p>
        
        <h3>Current Focus</h3>
        <p>Working at the intersection of classical philosophy and AI ethics, exploring how historical philosophical frameworks can help us navigate questions of moral agency, rationality, and intelligence in artificial systems.</p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        
        <h3>Normative Dimensions of Summarization</h3>
        <p>Examining how AI systems summarize public comments and input in normatively weighty contexts, with a focus on identifying whether these systems capture or miss morally significant perspectives.</p>
        <p>This research investigates three critical questions in AI-assisted democratic deliberation: (1) How are automated summarization systems currently used in policy contexts? (2) How are these models optimized, and what values do they prioritize? (3) What normative dimensions are overlooked, particularly high-signal, low-frequency perspectives that may hold moral significance?</p>

        <h3>Classical Source Analysis with LLMs</h3>
        <p>Developing innovative approaches to source analysis in classical Arabic, Syriac, and Greek texts using large language models, aiming to transform traditional philological methods.</p>
        <p>This project bridges computational linguistics with traditional philological methods to provide evidence-based insights into the transmission of philosophical ideas across linguistic and cultural boundaries. It helps scholars discover overlooked textual connections between Greek, Arabic, and other classical traditions.</p>

        <h3>Co-Director of AI and the Human</h3>
        <p>Leading initiatives on AI applications in humanities research and teaching, with a focus on faculty development and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
        <p>Coordinating a seminar series bringing together philosophers, ethicists, and AI researchers including David Chalmers, John Tasioulas, and Sina Fazelpour. The seminar examines how artificial intelligence reshapes our concepts of justice, power, and humanity through structured interdisciplinary conversations.</p>
        
        <h3>Nothing Infers: AI, Human Cognition, and the Taking Condition</h3>
        <p>Exploring how both AI systems (symbolic AI and large language models) and human cognition may fail to satisfy the philosophical "Taking Condition" for reasoning.</p>
        <p>Drawing on evidence from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, this paper argues that human cognition likely operates on similar principles to AI, particularly in its reliance on pattern recognition and statistical learning. This leads to the problematic conclusion that, under the current definition, nothing 'reasons' - suggesting we need to reconsider our definition of reasoning itself.</p>
        <p>Status: Under Review</p>
        
        <h3>Zotero PDF Chat</h3>
        <p>A tool that enables semantic search and AI-powered conversations with academic papers stored in your Zotero library.</p>
        <p>This project connects to local Zotero libraries, processes PDFs to create AI-readable embeddings, and allows users to ask questions about their documents. The system provides answers based on document content with citations from the source material, making it easier to engage with large collections of academic literature.</p>

        <h2>My Approach to AI in Humanities</h2>
        <p>I develop and teach the use of AI tools as <strong>supports</strong>, not <strong>shortcuts</strong>, for scholarly research. My philosophy emphasizes that these tools should help researchers focus on the most meaningful parts of scholarship: thinking, writing, and refining arguments. Used wisely, AI tools can save hours of effort while enhancing scholarly insight.</p>

        <h3>Research Methodology Integration</h3>
        <p>I've developed comprehensive methodologies combining traditional research approaches with modern AI tools, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Techniques for leveraging semantic search tools like Undermind for academic research</li>
            <li>Methods for integrating bibliographic management through Zotero with AI analysis</li>

    <!-- KANT ANALYSIS TOOL CONTENT -->
    <div id="kant-analysis" class="main-section">
        <h1>Ethical Analysis Tools: My Development Work</h1>

        <h2>Overview of My Ethical AI Tools</h2>
        <p>I've developed a suite of AI-powered tools for ethical analysis that bridge classical philosophical frameworks with modern AI capabilities. These tools help students and researchers systematically analyze ethical situations through different theoretical lenses.</p>

        <h2>Kantian Ethics Analyzer</h2>
        <p>My Kantian Ethics Analyzer tool extracts the underlying maxim of an action and tests it against Kant's categorical imperative. It systematically evaluates whether a maxim can be universalized without contradiction and whether it treats humanity as an end in itself.</p>
        
        <p>The tool employs a carefully calibrated prompting system that guides users through formulating maxims properly and applying the universalization and humanity formulas correctly. This addresses common misconceptions in applying Kantian ethics.</p>

        <h2>Consequentialist Analysis System</h2>
        <p>I designed this tool to provide structured analysis of ethical situations through consequentialist frameworks. It identifies all stakeholders, systematically evaluates immediate and long-term consequences, and assesses aggregate welfare impacts across different populations.</p>
        
        <p>The system incorporates nuanced considerations of welfare distribution and qualitative differences in outcomes that are often overlooked in simplistic consequentialist analyses.</p>

        <h2>Virtue Ethics Framework</h2>
        <p>This tool, which I developed for teaching virtue ethics, helps users identify relevant virtues and vices in ethical situations and evaluate how actions reflect and impact character development. It incorporates classical Aristotelian concepts of practical wisdom (phronesis) and flourishing (eudaimonia).</p>
        
        <p>The framework is designed to highlight the context-sensitivity of virtue ethics and show how the same action might express different virtues or vices depending on the agent's character and circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Pedagogical Applications</h2>
        <p>I've implemented these tools in undergraduate philosophy courses to help students gain deeper understanding of ethical theories by seeing them applied systematically. Student feedback indicates that interacting with these tools helps clarify abstract theoretical concepts and reveals the practical differences between ethical frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>The tools serve not just as analytical aids but as pedagogical devices that help students recognize the structure and reasoning patterns of different ethical traditions.</p>

        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p>These tools are built using advanced LLM technology with carefully designed prompting structures. They rely on OpenAI's API infrastructure and can be accessed through simple web interfaces. The systems incorporate safeguards against common errors in ethical reasoning.</p>
