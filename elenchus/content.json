The complexity of the climate problem provides endless opportunities for such rationalization. We can always point to scientific uncertainty, to the costs of action, to the failures of other nations, to the needs of the present generation.

      "why_characteristic": "Gardiner's most original and disturbing contribution. The concept of 'moral corruption' -- as distinct from mere failure to act -- elevates the analysis from environmental policy to moral psychology. The enumeration of rationalizations ('scientific uncertainty... costs of action... failures of other nations') is pointed: each is a real consideration being deployed in bad faith. The metaphor of the 'smokescreen' captures how legitimate moral considerations can function as instruments of self-deception."

Where most philosophers of self-termination begin from autonomy and argue about its limits, Velleman questions whether the autonomy framework even applies.
